[00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.590] today has been such a total adhd day that i basically like almost just can't believe it [00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.510] um i just came to my room um which finally i have for myself thank god um [00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.830] just to like voice journal about some of the things that are like running in my head

[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.220] first of all i'm just so disappointed like at myself i think i already wrote that in the [00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.700] previous voice message because of that like today i took ritalin i i know i didn't really [00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.540] have that many distractions i wasn't like talking to that many people people were not talking to me [00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.340] i didn't really have an excuse like you know i'm the captAIn of my own destiny and i'm the captAIn [00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.700] of my own days and i'm just apparently a really bad one like you know like i was in charge today [00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:14.270] i can't point fingers i can't blame others um and like i didn't do it like i didn't even [00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:24.720] like really get started on the task i didn't even try um until very very late and then i finally [00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.960] i then i was like actually doing it but then in my head i was like still thinking about like all [00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520] these things until i realized i had a moment where i was like oh wAIt i'm i'm actually doing it right [00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.880] now you know but like it felt almost like oh no i'm just like skimming through it but i'm not [00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.680] actually like working on it um so anyway i was just like wAIt i'm doing it right now um and i [00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.680] know that calmed me down a little bit but like not quite because i just felt like i was like [00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.920] overthinking it too much instead of just picking like one project and just doing the homework [00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.480] around it uh which is not even like the final project like it doesn't matter what i pick now [00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.120] um but obviously i was like oh yeah let's orient this towards like the actual final project that [00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.360] i would want to have and so yeah that is making me like overthink it but like the deadline is tomorrow [00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.880] and like agAIn this is not like ceo like attitude ceo behaviors like like this morning i was thinking [00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.880] of like oh maybe i should do those like making decisions under uncertAInty like other courses [00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.560] but like like reading one of those books maybe that would help me like is that the problem is [00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.320] that i don't know like how to choose is like i don't know how to make a decision like i don't [00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:47.300] know like it's it's it's like the firmware that's running in my head is just um not right and how do [00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.260] i fix that right i feel like i feel like i've been able to like change the firmware in some regards [00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.740] like for example with the like anxiety thing and spiraling and stuff like that but i feel like today [00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.460] some of or like these past few days or something something that has happened is a little more [00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.140] similar to that so i don't know if i'm like regressing or something i haven't been doing [00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.140] like meditation in a very long time and maybe that is also impacting me a little bit um but [00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.180] i don't know i was doing quite well even without doing it so i thought like you know like i was [00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.100] like fixed or something um and so i don't know if it's related i'm just like or or maybe i was [00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.220] okay because it was just like a special special like chapter or moment or something special as [00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.540] in like not like my usual but okay i'm just gonna dump some of the like thoughts and worries and [00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.060] stuff that i had today so i mean what happened so first of all i already explAIned like in the [00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.180] morning i decided to like go out and get something like groceries and i don't know if i got too [00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.820] distracted or what and then after that like i should have just fucking taken the ritalin that's [00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.060] like mistake number one but even when i take it sometimes like i still get like super distracted [00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.860] like even today after taking it i was still like distracted for a while but like it helps at least [00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.340] put me in like a different mode a little bit um because like even when i was on my laptop and [00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.060] i got distracted like getting distracted with like prompting AIs is not productive [00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.980] but it's better than like scrolling social media um but it still means that i'm not like doing [00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.980] my thing so it's easy to fall for that because in my head it's like oh yeah so you know i don't want [00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.220] i started feeling guilty at some point that my AIs has not been working at all all day like imagine [00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.220] if it's like 5 p.m i'm like oh my god have i completely wasted all these like subscriptions [00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.580] and tokens and stuff because they haven't been working at all but of course like getting them [00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.460] to work on something takes uh like warm-up time right and because i don't have the right system [00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.220] set up yet it takes even longer because i open the terminal and it's like oh all the sessions [00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.220] have closed and now how do i get to continue the sessions and now i have to like scroll up and be [00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.100] like oh what was the conversation in this session and how do i reinstantiate an AI and get it to get [00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.860] all the context that was in this like conversation um and that takes a while right so there's this [00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.780] like warm-up time that just makes things inefficient because i can't just like go [00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.620] and like open it and just continue it um and then i have all these like little problems like oh you [00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.820] know when i like use codecs i can't scroll up oh when i use tmax i have to like write these comments [00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.900] and then it takes a while and it's a pAIn in the ass how do i not do that and then i go and like do [00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.060] like a quick like perplexity query i'm like how to not do that and then it tells me and then i fix [00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.420] it and it's like but there's like a ton of like small things like that where like if i was doing [00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.300] that in one sitting i could like fix a lot of them and so next time i don't have to like [00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.980] but like because i don't do it it's always like little by little but literally it just feels [00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.060] infinite right and so then and at some point i'm like wAIt i've spent too much time on this shit [00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.340] like i'm just gonna go like ignore this like don't feel bad about it and just go do the bio stuff like [00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.380] your actual tasks um but then somehow i just like end up regressing and then another way in which i [00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.380] also wasted a lot of time is because i just went to like amazon and aliexpress and stuff [00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.500] to like order stuff for the room which is like and i even told myself like it's fine it's not [00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.340] urgent you don't you can wAIt for one day like you have a deadline tomorrow you can just order [00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.940] those things like tomorrow or the day after it's fine but then part of me is like wAIt no because [00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.220] aliexpress takes a long time to ship and so two days can make like a big difference because [00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.220] sometimes it's like the weekend is in the middle and like whatever so let's just do it quickly i [00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.580] was like i have like a clear idea of what i want it's just like three items and like blah blah blah [00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.780] and it's just never like that it's never ever ever like that on amazon maybe and aliexpress a [00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.140] little bit less um and i also checked some stuff on amazon because i'm like what if i can just have [00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.260] it like quicker deliver quicker and i just wasted a ton of time and then it was another query that i [00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.180] wanted to run in the background just asking about like so you're like oh where can i buy like cheap [00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.740] like clothes or home decor or something because i mean that is something like i need like pajamas [00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.380] and i need like other clothes that i didn't bring um and but it's like it also kind of [00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.900] counts a little bit like a distraction but like okay fine that was just like a couple of minutes [00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:17.090] so then how did i waste like more than 10 hours um then yeah i don't know what else happened but [00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:24.210] it's like this like constant ping pong of different like things that's just like everything besides [00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.490] doing the actual thing because i even at some point was like oh let's just prompt the AIs in [00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:34.450] the background to run to create this like web app course that i can study the hggeaa stuff from [00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.410] and the point is in my head it's like i'm just gonna give it like one or two prompts and just [00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.650] leave it in the background running and then i'm gonna do my actual task and then by the time i'm [00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.090] done with my task i have the fruits of the AIs labor and so things feel more efficient because [00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.610] otherwise i finish the mAIn task and i'm like oh shit now i have to start up the AI just to start [00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.490] working on the thing and then i will have to wAIt it's like it's like harvesting right it's like [00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.170] planting the seeds and then you like collect the seeds but it's like because i haven't planted the [00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.410] seed i won't be able to collect the seed and it's the same with like the paper reader mentor app [00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.050] which i would love to have like it would be really useful to have that but it will take a while to [00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.130] get that like proper and then agAIn if i just keep doing the same where i'm just jumping around so [00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:23.170] many different things it's never gonna actually like get finish because i'm just working across [00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.370] different projects and part of it is because of the way the AI works right like you prompt it you [00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.370] ask it to do something and then you just wAIt and sometimes it will take 30 minutes sometimes it [00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.290] takes five minutes and then it's even hard to figure out like when it has like finished when [00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:39.810] it's like wAIting for your input i did get two projects at least to like notify me on telegram [00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.930] i don't know if that is now like fixed but yeah that would like help a lot although i don't really [00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:51.250] check telegram when i'm like trying to focus because i get messages from friends so like [00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.610] maybe i need to find like a different route like something that's connected to my [00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:03.550] mac uh it shows me that message um or something so that i don't need to like open the app because [00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.790] then i get too distracted with messages from other people and i don't want to see messages [00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:13.550] from people during like my work hours right so you know actually maybe this is like a good like [00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.950] feedback for myself a good criticism which is that i think i'd fAIl i fAIl at this like i open [00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.630] telegram at some point maybe because i'm like using like safe messages and other things and [00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:30.190] um and then like i know i get like a message from danny and that reminded me of something like [00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.590] my mom and then yeah i had to handle like my dad's thing so i also like received a message like [00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:40.750] from like my family and being like you know like this like relative it's like right now [00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.110] quite depressed because they don't have like the hearing AIds because they're all relying [00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.870] on me to do things and i was doing like research like i call different like stores and stuff but [00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.790] it's like i got the last quote on like saturday and until i got that quote i didn't want to make [00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.070] a decision but then like today i had to like call the store agAIn so it's like once that message [00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:04.270] popped up i had to completely stop everything else that i was doing to try to like handle that task [00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:10.590] but then because it was like past 1 30 i couldn't call the second store only the first one and then [00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:16.190] i had to set an alarm for like 4 p.m to restart that at 4 p.m and go and call the other one [00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.670] but it's like you know that also requires some like perplexity like research and so it's like [00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.510] it took me out of everything that i like i actually had to do to like go and do the thing [00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.830] and then i was like okay fine well i'm just gonna leave this until four so i can go and like do [00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.310] other things but then during that time i don't know if i went to like i think i went to like [00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.630] cook and eat or something but then or like i don't remember nothing i cooked that they [00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:43.390] got earlier but i wasn't hungry because i took the ritalin and then yeah like four um [00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.310] i was doing something else so i didn't call yet and then i think i called around like five or [00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.790] something when i went back to my laptop and i know what i did like during the rest of the time [00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.310] honestly but yeah it took like a little bit of like ritalin top up and then you know at four [00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.910] i had to do the same thing and i don't know how long it like took doing the thing and it's always [00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.310] the same it's like you talk to them you're like wAIt let me send you a message later or i'll [00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.550] contact you later or i have to ask somebody else let me give you an answer later and then you have [00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.550] to wAIt and sometimes you have to wAIt for a day like you have to wAIt for the message and then [00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.510] you don't check the message on the spot because they send it like to my other phone and then like [00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.710] by the time i read it it's like 7 30 and so they close at 8 and it's like the same cycle right and [00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.310] so now it's like something that i still have pending and honestly like it's also so expensive [00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.030] that i just i can't choose there's a bit of like money like paralysis money just like decision [00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:39.470] making paralysis um but i mean that's kind of like what happened like i have to like jump in [00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.310] and out of things instead of just being able to like block out everything and just do the things [00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.150] like even if i blocked out everything it's even hard to like get myself to just be like yeah i'm [00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:52.190] just gonna do this thing and i don't really know why um agAIn it's because i have all these like [00:11:52.190 --> 00:12:01.950] literal excuses of like oh but first but first but first and so yeah i'm like super disappointed [00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.390] with that and then uh there's like another complAInt that like no complAInt but like [00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:14.110] overthinking pattern that i will maybe talk about in a different one um let's see [00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:26.380] um which is writing the title um this is like a vent um but yeah there's like a couple of other [00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:33.100] things that just like hopping around that made me kind of distracted about how i don't like either [00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.900] like seeing people around or like chatting with people that just made me think about things like [00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:47.490] how i don't have and like wasting time because like like other people around me who are like [00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:52.290] much younger are like doing much more serious stuff than i was doing at that age and then like [00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.890] but that's fine like you know we're like different like whatever but like um it makes me think of [00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:03.250] like other people that i admire and how i think about the fact that uh they you know started much [00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:08.450] younger like really honing their like thinking skills and knowledge and stuff like two of my [00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.730] role models they like dropped out or something but they were studying like physics and i had [00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.890] like one of them and there were like two girls one of them started like was very passionate about [00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.650] physics when she was like a teenager and what the fuck was i doing as a teenager i was just like [00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:28.690] playing fucking video games or something um and so you know seeing the person and then i don't know i [00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:34.850] saw like the website of like another like influential figure in like sweden valley and [00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.530] they write all these um the word is not like attitudes just like beliefs like one-liner [00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.010] like beliefs or thoughts stuff like that perspectives and they're very well thought [00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.530] out right and so i was like you know what does it take to get to that point where [00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:58.210] you develop those thoughts and you were able to articulate them so well um and then you know i [00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:03.650] think to myself well yeah this is like a skill that one can develop like like i can also develop [00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.890] that skill right like others can also but then part of me was also thinking like oh maybe like [00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.810] you know this person is just like higher IQ and the other people i'm thinking about they are just [00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.050] really fucking higher IQ and they're like way more impressive and they're it's like [00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:22.130] i will never get the over journeys that um that they have had and they have because i just can't [00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.650] catch up to that level right like i can catch up on like one front but not all of them like you [00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:31.730] can really like fake IQ or whatever um but it's like okay but the i mean yes that's like true on [00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.010] one hand but on the other hand it's like there's definitely a lot that you can do to like improve [00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:42.210] on fronts that are really like compensatory right like yeah maybe you can like [00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.810] speed around studying physics or maybe you can do that but if you're doing that then you can [00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.850] also do like um study about like politics or something right it's like you can only choose [00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.770] like one thing and you have to go like fully like completely focus on that thing and then [00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.330] but then i'm like okay well yeah i could like spend so much more time [00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:09.730] on things like well how to like speak more articulately and how to like really like express [00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.130] my ideas or how to even like build up my sort of like mental arguments like i don't even know how [00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:21.170] to describe this but it's like um like i've been getting really good feedback from claude um i just [00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:27.330] like uploaded some like rambling voice recordings and actually i can do that with this one also more [00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.690] like unstructured voice recordings and then i would get like and i get claude to give me feedback [00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:39.920] on you know where am i fAIling in my communication why am i rambling so much why do i sound so [00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.200] scattered and so disorganized in my speaking and in my thinking because that's also what claude sAId [00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.240] like i speak like that because i think like that right it is a direct representation so i'm like [00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.280] how do i fix that um i'm not sure how for right now like well they did give me like a few exercises [00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.360] that i do need to try and actually i could just pick some sentences here or i can get claude to [00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.380] pick some sentences from some of these and just practice rewriting them and just being much [00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:20.060] clearer um and i lost my trAIn of thought because i was thinking that i really have less time for [00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:30.530] the deadline than i'm thinking um and yeah so you know like that's like a very high i don't know how [00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:36.130] we call it like higher ROI or something skill to focus on right because like if i just like go and [00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:42.930] study i don't know physics or history or something it's like it's not gonna show as much and it's [00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:50.690] like in this case this like showing does matter it's it's not about like impressing others or [00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.650] anything it's not so much about like the image but it's more like you know learning how to like [00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:07.310] be more articulate is learning how to think better um and so you know being a good thinker [00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:14.830] is a skill that is highly appreciated because it can be applied to many different like areas right and [00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.830] it's like it's a skill that i'm lacking right now but unfortunately i'm also lacking like other [00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.590] skills like i don't really have that much like accumulated knowledge right like i feel like i [00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.750] don't have enough like crystallized nor fluid knowledge and then it's like okay what do i do [00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.470] do i just like give up on life or what but that also doesn't make sense like i should still strive [00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:42.350] to do the best that i can especially if it's in my hands to improve some of some of i mean these like [00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:49.630] flaws or shortcomings basically um but yeah there's like constant feeling of overwhelm or like [00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:58.910] of frustration i don't have many more words to describe this like pressure of like maybe a little [00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:06.770] bit of like hopelessness um because i just feel like i can't catch up because i just feel like no [00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:12.930] matter how much time and effort i put into it and then the problem is that i even feel like i'm just [00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.810] not putting in enough like time and effort because i'm being fucking like adhd and i'm lacking that [00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.930] source of urgency and i don't know what the fuck i'm doing but like i feel like even if i put in [00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:31.490] so much a ton of like time and energy and effort and focus like even if i was able to like execute [00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:40.930] that perfectly um i would still be so behind and i don't know how to sort of like i don't think the [00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:46.530] word is like cope with that like integrate that like deal with that like i don't even know how [00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:53.890] to describe these like feelings or stances or like attitudes or like what i'm thinking about [00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.970] i'm feeling like i don't even know how to like describe it but there's like a little bit of like [00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:05.890] hopelessness and it's like demotivating um and well there's like two components one of them is [00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.090] like it makes you feel a little bit hopeless and it makes you feel a little bit demotivated but then [00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:16.930] i'm i'm not the kind of person who like can't just like lose motivation like if that makes sense [00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:24.130] like you know tomorrow comes and like i have to do something right so i have to pick what to focus [00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:29.570] on and i think that's the next component that's the next stage that's like hard which is that [00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.410] okay yeah like i have these thoughts and then i'm like oh shit you know i'm like i'm so fucking [00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:41.650] far behind uh and like even if i like focused perfectly for the next like year [00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:49.810] or something i would still be fucking like i would still be like so far away from and also [00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:55.250] this is not the right english expression far away from someone but it's like far away from being at [00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:03.010] the level of any of these people that i admire and and obviously that's demotivating and and [00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:08.370] it triggers that sense of internal desperation to be like wAIt but is there anything i can do better [00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.010] like maybe i'm not focusing on the right thing maybe i'm like neglecting other areas that [00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.770] that could actually get me much closer to that like maybe i don't need to like [00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.170] i don't know like be at home and like read about like certAIn things like maybe i should be reading [00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.370] about those other things maybe i should be reading papers but wAIt no maybe i don't need to read [00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:31.170] papers it's better to just focus on the a agents but then if i only focus on the agents i'm not [00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:36.770] growing my like biology knowledge but if i'm doing biology knowledge or like agents i'm not [00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:43.250] working on focusing on my thinking and for that maybe i need to write more but if i write then [00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.970] i'm not developing my agents or my biology skills and then it's like a part of me is like well why [00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.570] can i do like three of them why can i have like different focus blocks in the day to focus on [00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.890] different things on you know to allocate to different things but things like other tasks [00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:01.970] pop up and it's like there's like a big percentage of the day which i just like waste [00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:08.690] doing i don't know what i have no idea how that happens um that's why i've been trying to build [00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.370] these tools to sort of like ask me like already what are you doing that's why i tried to set the [00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:18.050] physical timer and it would help me a lot to just have like a watch where i can set alarm every hour [00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:25.490] or something or 30 minutes just just like check check in with myself like am i doing what i need [00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.490] to be doing right like one of the reasons why i go distracted after like i use the 10 minute [00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.730] timers and at some point i actually did the thing and then i stopped and i went to get a snack and [00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.290] then i didn't set any other timers and that's why i like didn't get back on track right i think it's [00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.650] really really really really fundamental for me to to have that sort of like scaffolding around [00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:49.650] me full of reminders and timers and stuff like that because i just i have like total like time [00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:54.610] blindness and priority blindness and like it's like if i stop and think about it yes but then [00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.570] i just get lost in my head i just get lost in my thoughts and i get like distracted and that's how [00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.770] my brAIn works and it's fucking broken it's fucking like flawed but it's like if i had the [00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:11.230] right scaffolding you know i could be a little bit more on track and it's not that i want to [00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:21.790] deflect responsibility onto some abstract vague like entity or future hypothetical like future [00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:28.110] but or like alternative like world where i have if i have all these scaffolding that will be like [00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.670] perfect but it's like you know i do see the results it's like when i take risks i don't [00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:38.590] talk which then i see it so when i put on my headphones and i set a timer like the chances [00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:43.790] of success and being focused are just so much fucking higher i'm looking at the time and it's [00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:48.430] just like how am i supposed to not feel hopeless when it's like 11 p.m and what the fuck am i [00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:52.910] doing but it's like honestly like this is like one point where i'm like i do feel like i actually [00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:57.470] need to like sit down and voice journal about it because otherwise it's just like running in my head [00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:05.380] and it's better if i can like put it in here and then process it with claude i think in the past [00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.580] a lot of my journals haven't been like as useful because i was not able to like process them [00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.860] and so it's pointless if you just like log what's happening but don't actually are not able to like [00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:22.420] go through it because if you go through it and but you don't have it sort of like in text in front [00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:29.220] of you or like pre-processed like processed by like another thing then you just kind of like go [00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.740] in loops it's like you have to like regenerate the content anyway i don't need to like explAIn that [00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:42.940] it doesn't matter but like um i already journaled about how i was not journaling right and i do [00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.100] actually really have no but i have not been doing that enough because it's been like for real like [00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:53.020] january has been like so intense december was so intense and i just didn't really journal that much [00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.700] about it and like i just like came to the end it's like what things are going through my mind like [00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:04.380] what's the experience like like how is it different or how is it like similar to what i was [00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:09.180] like imagining you know like those things are things that i want to record for the future [00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:15.420] because this is shaping my my thinking and my personality and and it's shaping me right like [00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.700] these life experiences and same thing with like what's happening with my family and stuff [00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.860] um so it's could be important to like journal about them like maybe i need to you know maybe i [00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:30.620] need to get stricter with routines like right now it's pretty uninterrupted most of my days here [00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:37.180] i can do what i want i can set set up my day the way that i want and if i want i can even get [00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.900] like accountability by you know scheduling with other people let's all do meditation at this time [00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:51.010] or something like that um so and there's like a sauna and i could implement but the sauna like [00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:58.930] messes up my hAIr and that's too much work but in like cold showers i should do more of that [00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:05.730] i don't know and the thing is the thing is yeah i just really thought like when i was like up there [00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:10.770] and i just keep seeing seeing myself either getting distracted or going on into this loop [00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:15.410] that was like okay i need to like break out of this somehow like either go meditate or just [00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.970] like i don't know do something different right like i can't sign up for the gym it's too expensive [00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:25.840] right now i can really go for a run i don't have like a like a jacket that i can use for that and [00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:33.120] it's like it's cold and also it's not the nicest area i think for that um but sometimes like you [00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.800] know just break out of that and and i think this just coming to my room and like journaling and [00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.440] dumping this is good because lately what i've been doing is when i've when i'm at that like [00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.640] mental loop mode and i thought to myself oh should i journal about this i'm like no no [00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.400] journaling at this point is like a waste of time you've already seen it never leads to anything [00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.920] and so i just push myself to do other things but like today i just realized i'm so stuck like [00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.760] i've already been trying to like focus on the thing and like okay no and also like my other [00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:10.000] argument is also that if i don't capture it as it is happening because i was like i can just like [00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.680] journal about this later but like no i want to capture it as it is happening because [00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.840] that's how i can get the most accurate representation of like the problem that i [00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:28.240] want to fix right and so i hope this voice journal is useful for that and but yeah i think i don't [00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:34.960] have i covered everything well yeah yeah like my last like sort of like thinking or like overthinking [00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.960] was about the whole like yeah like like age and catching up and also like some of these people [00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.120] that i was like talking about uh not like the people around me but like the people those like [00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.360] people that i don't know and that like i admire their like thinking or their trajectory or things [00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.560] that they have achieved like um this last one that i was like reading the website of [00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.160] like like he sAId that he went to MIT and i'm like well you know part of me is like [00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.080] because i was like analyzing the the writing and i was like well he like this person thinks so [00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.880] clearly and like what does it take to get there and then i guess at the MIT thing and i was like [00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.880] well you know i think like being putting yourself in this environment or being in this environment [00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.880] like surrounded by people who really like shape your like way of thinking like there's more like [00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:30.720] critical or like proper way that helps a lot and it's like if you are just like by yourself or like [00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:38.800] in other environments it's really hard to mold your thinking in that way right um and so i have [00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.000] to spend like way too much time sort of like i don't know by myself or not really like interacting [00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.480] with people in this sort of like intellectually challenging way right um at all like too little [00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.880] and so when you join an institution like that and you're there every day it's really hard to like [00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.730] quote-unquote escape that part that you just like throw yourself in it and and having that external [00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:04.290] really helps a lot but then it's like well i would not even be able like i see some of these people [00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:14.450] i'm like i just wouldn't even have the chance to like you know like get to like places like that [00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.450] with very few more people and like but like okay that's not like what i was thinking i was also [00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.570] thinking like no there's like definitely ways to like sort of like get to places like that doesn't [00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.970] have to be specifically this one okay there's like a lot like this well not that many i promise that [00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:33.490] there's not that many but like even this one it's like well you know i don't have like good grades [00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:41.360] so i don't have like the chance to go someplace like that um now that i'm doing for example the [00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:48.800] MIT hgga maybe they will help me like next year uh join like a bio master somewhere even if i [00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.400] don't have like a bio bachelor's um and like didn't finish my bachelor's like usually they [00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.840] require that for master's but in some places they allow you to join if you can show that you've like [00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.680] worked in a field or have enough experience or have like other courses and stuff and so [00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.280] it's kind of discretionary so i could have a chance but probably not at the like top places [00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.760] you know it would still be at like more random places and i'm like i don't want to comMIT to [00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.320] spending one year in some like very random city and country where like i still don't feel like i'm [00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:27.040] in the type of environment that really like aligns with me right um and so you know i just feel like [00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:33.120] i don't have like access to places that could actually shape me in the ways that that like [00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:42.080] could help me become like unlock that version of me that i dream about being which is the one [00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:49.760] agAIn is able to just speak well articulate the thoughts is smart knows how to like intuitively [00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.200] apply like decision making frameworks if that makes sense i'm just giving like random examples [00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:02.080] but like overall just somebody who thinks well who is smart has like a lattice of of like like [00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.600] has like good models of how the world works and and like how the world like was like built and [00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.600] interconnects all these different ideas from these different fields and like you know that's [00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.720] something that i'm passionate about but apparently i'm not as passionate about it if i'm just spending [00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.560] like 24 hours on that or like that's kind of like my mental picture of how somebody like me who gets [00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:25.840] very easily obsessed with things and um would would do it if they were like i i don't know man [00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.840] i'm just like i'm okay i'm like fucking going on a tangent now but it's like it's also another one [00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.400] of my like self criticisms internal self criticisms that i like throw at myself sometimes and so i [00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:43.120] think it's good to just like counter it here um but yeah and so it's like fuck i'm i'm at a loss [00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.800] and then even if i'm like okay like what if my strategy is like no sorry no like okay what if i [00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.480] just like you know some of these like places are it's not like impossible to get there but it was [00:30:52.480 --> 00:31:00.910] just like for someone like me in my position it would take like a long time of being very like [00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:07.150] sort of like strategic like focus like like have like one specific plan with one very clear [00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.150] objective like goal and end point and just like go for it but it would still take me probably like [00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.910] two years or a year and a half or something or you know maybe there's always like shortcuts that [00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.910] i'm like not seeing or not thinking about or maybe i'm not like being self-confident enough to like [00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:27.150] go and like try those but um um yeah but then you know it would take like two years so for example [00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:32.430] like with lab stuff right i'm like damn i wish i could join like a top lab but like for example [00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:38.190] even if you know i haven't even like applied yet like adhd and like um you know prioritizing all [00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:42.990] the things and it's like well you know like a path would be like doing stuff here and trying [00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.630] to like build good projects cool projects and like contribute to papers and whatever and like [00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.630] i don't know maybe like trying to get into like a cool masters but then i wouldn't be able to like [00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:55.390] afford it but like whatever yeah some people say like you can get a loan but like it doesn't matter [00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.910] but then it's like okay and then i would have to what finish the masters and then apply for the lab [00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:03.390] i want to but then it's been like a year and a half or two years or something and i'm like do i [00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.750] will i still be dreaming of joining that lab two years from now as like a junior or intern or [00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:14.750] something like probably not and so that's also the difficult part that i realize is that the [00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:19.230] the older that i get the less open i will be to different things that i'm open to right now because [00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.190] right now i'm like okay i have like changed fields and i've changed roles and stuff multiple times [00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:30.110] and i have to always start from scratch from like a really low position and it's like at [00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:34.110] some point it's like damn you know i should be already doing more like senior stuff not starting [00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.910] with like an internship at this point but then it's like well you know i still like i have to [00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:44.350] deal with it because well it's like i decided to start from scratch in a different like area [00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:49.630] and so that's how it goes and you just have to accept it and you're not gonna have to do this [00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:56.670] always but it's like but i'm just scared that you know what if like two years from now i'm still in [00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:03.950] a position where where i haven't like gone in deeply anywhere and i'm still kind of like [00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.150] i don't know what the word is it's not like drifting it reminds me of the concept of being [00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:16.830] a digital nomad but it's like in your career and where you're just like trying a little bit here [00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:23.950] and then trying a little bit there and then you're not an expert in anything and then who are you [00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:30.990] what value do you bring how are you hireable why would people like you know pay like a full salary [00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:34.910] to like have you how do you like contribute value and the problem is that there's things that people [00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:39.710] would hire me for but that because they're not super specialized or technical i'm not like [00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.070] interested in i don't want to be a marketing person i don't want to be a biz dev person [00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:50.110] i already tried that for a little bit i'm i'm over that like it's not fulfilling like i want to build [00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:54.110] my mind and my thinking and i want to work on things that feel challenging for my brAIn and [00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.030] make me feel like i'm learning and i fucking hate doing things where i'm not fucking learning and i [00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:03.310] have to like do that outside of my job especially because my job my job is like my life my identity [00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:08.740] and i can't do work life balance and i have no interest in doing work life balance like if it's [00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.180] a job then i don't want to merge with my life and i don't want to make my identity in my life [00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:17.060] and like i don't want it once there sort of speak and that makes things really hard [00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.380] because agAIn i'm not in a position to be super choosy but on the other hand i have managed to be [00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:30.180] choosy and i can't say it has worked well in the sense that i'm like not totally in a good position [00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:35.860] but like you know like at least i have been able to actually stay focused on the things that i'm [00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.740] interested in and say no to things and i'm like incredibly privileged for that i'm very grateful [00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.500] and it makes me incredibly anxious to think that i won't always you know that's also like there's [00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.460] like a time liMIT for that because it's like liMITed like resources and it makes me insanely [00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:54.660] insanely insanely stressed out and scared of thinking of running out of like you know like [00:34:54.660 --> 00:35:00.100] my runway and my opportunities and stuff and being forced to like do shit that really takes me away [00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.340] like if i'm like forced to take on like a i don't even do marketing i'm just saying like a random [00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:09.780] thing okay but like marketing job and agAIn i will spend like 10 hours per day on that and i won't [00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:16.100] have time to do the things like critical thinking writing or studying AI agents or like studying [00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:23.220] biology and developing biotech projects it's a random thing okay because even if i was doing [00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.300] family marketing we would probably be with AI agents but also like i would never be hiring [00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.700] for marketing because i don't have skills in marketing but that's the problem i don't really [00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.780] have skills in anything at this point that it's like a specific thing i'm kind of like a journalist [00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:41.540] and i guess some people some places hire that but i would like to be in a place that trAIns [00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.380] me as a specialist in something because i should be a specialist in at least something and in the [00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:49.700] past i was a specialist in something or was becoming specialist in something but now it's [00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.100] like so completely unrelated to what i'm doing and what i'm interested in that is completely pointless [00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.500] it's like it's like that got wiped from my life and my experience i can't mention that so it's [00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:04.100] like it doesn't exist and that fucking sucks but agAIn i made a decision and this time i don't [00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:09.380] think i'm going to change that much more um so like this time it does feel definitive and i've [00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:15.300] stuck to this like for a very long time and it is like actually something that i've been saying for [00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:22.260] even an even longer time but um okay i think this like helps put into perspective kind of like what's [00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.970] been going on but now the problem is i'm gonna have to like transcribe this and wAIt for it to [00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:46.020] be transcribed and then i won't be fully focused on any other thing because i'll be wAIting for one [00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.340] hour for this to finish to then go and put it into quad and then i'll be like agAIn there's no [00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.300] expression in english for this like my brAIn will have this like constantly running thread [00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:00.660] because it's just awAIting like clause response or awAIting processing because this is like a [00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:08.100] thread that's like open and it's like it needs closure right i have that urge for closure which [00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.620] just isn't fully gonna come because it's not like i'm gonna get like magic answers or anything but [00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.900] like i feel like i really want to like go and talk to someone about this like not actually [00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.940] because i don't think there's like any single human who has like enough context and knowledge [00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:27.060] and everything to to even like listen to this whole ramble and but you know AIs are like able [00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:32.020] to parse that and that's very helpful and so it also means that i can really accelerate the progress [00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.900] in terms of solving all of these threats because i can get AI to actually address all of them like [00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.620] listen to me quote-unquote talk for 38 minutes which is how long i've been recording this for [00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:49.060] at this point and then get to address every single point which a human would not do and not do [00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:54.020] satisfactorily like i don't know it doesn't matter agAIn i'm just like fucking rambling like oh my [00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.620] god if i'm like rambling on my age how much am i gonna ramble when i'm like 80 years old [00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:03.860] it's like insane to think about but yeah here it is i need to parse this
