## Futura Bold

Futura is a commercial font. To use it:

1. Purchase Futura Bold from a font foundry
2. Convert to WOFF2 format
3. Save as `futura-bold.woff2` in this directory

**Current fallback:** Impact, Arial Black, sans-serif

If Futura is not available, the system will use the fallback stack which provides similar geometric proportions.
