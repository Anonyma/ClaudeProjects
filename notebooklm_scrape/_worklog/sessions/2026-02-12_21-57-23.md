## Prompt
- Fix prototype module feedback: Split Lens needs clearer contrast, Story Heatmap should load, Evidence Stack should expand, Scenario Slider should explain itself, Orbit Timeline should show a real example, and add more dynamic module showcases.

## Plan
- Enhance the learning-lab dynamic prototype with clearer contrast visuals and richer module behaviors.
- Replace any brittle chart dependencies with simple, reliable in-page visuals.
- Add a couple of extra module patterns for review.
- Verify the prototype structure and log updates.

## Work Summary
- Refined Orbit Timeline with richer details and clickable chips that update a multi-line card.
- Added visual contrast metrics to Split Lens and fixed the lens text updates.
- Rebuilt Scenario Slider with a canvas plot, legend, and responsive redraw.
- Added Artifact Carousel and Concept Matrix modules for additional interactive patterns.
- Removed remaining fragile dependencies and verified required sections exist.

## Files Changed
- study-app/prototypes/learning-lab-dynamics.html

## Verification
- python: checked prototype for expected sections and removed dependencies
