## Prompt
- Fix prototype module feedback: Split Lens needs clearer contrast, Story Heatmap should load, Evidence Stack should expand, Scenario Slider should explain itself, Orbit Timeline should show a real example, and add more dynamic module showcases.

## Plan
- Enhance the learning-lab dynamic prototype with clearer contrast visuals and richer module behaviors.
- Replace any brittle chart dependencies with simple, reliable in-page visuals.
- Add a couple of extra module patterns for review.
- Verify the prototype structure and log updates.

## Work Summary
- Added real-example detail cards and chips to the Constellation Graph, plus hover/click updates.
- Upgraded Orbit Timeline with active dots, richer event details, and synchronized chips.
- Expanded Scenario Slider with chart + live curriculum outputs that change by intensity.
- Made Split Lens show metric bars and a contrast summary per lens.
- Made Evidence Stack accordion visible via aria toggles, plus heatmap click-to-explain detail.
- Upgraded Artifact Carousel with real image examples, preview panel, and active states.

## Files Changed
