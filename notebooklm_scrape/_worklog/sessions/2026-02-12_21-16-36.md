## Prompt
- Reduce oversized article images, speed up load, add sidebar collapse, fix image issues, and research/preview richer study UI patterns. Also fix emoji thumbnails for specific lessons.

## Plan
- Write tests for gallery filtering, image sizing, sidebar toggle, lazy content loading, and thumbnail overrides.
- Implement UI/perf changes and update broken automation images.
- Add curated thumbnail overrides for the missing lessons and regenerate assets.
- Build a prototype learning lab page with interactive elements and document library recommendations.
- Verify tests, update logs, commit, and redeploy.

## Work Summary
- Added tests covering gallery filtering, image sizing, lazy local-content loading, sidebar toggle, automation images, and thumbnail overrides.
- Reduced article image footprint, filtered inline images from the gallery, and added a collapsible sidebar with hover peek.
- Scheduled local content loading to run after initial render and parallelized local JSON fetches to speed startup.
- Fixed Automation article image URLs to use working Wikipedia thumbnails.
- Added curated thumbnail overrides for “The Ethics of Raw Concrete” and “The Rococo Rebellion,” regenerated local assets, and added a learning-lab prototype page with interactive elements.
