# Session 2026-02-12_20-27-12

## Prompt
- Replace emoji thumbnails with real, thematic images for lesson cards; provide a work log path for recent changes.

## Plan
- Generate a curated thumbnail set from Wikipedia/Commons and store locally in the app.
- Wire thumbnail overrides into the card rendering pipeline.
- Verify overrides coverage and update work logs.

## Work Summary
- Added a thumbnail fetch script to download curated lesson images and store local overrides.
- Added a local overrides dataset for all 44 generated lessons plus attribution metadata.
- Updated the app to load overrides and use them as primary lesson thumbnails.
- Redeployed the Netlify site with the new assets.

- study-app/assets/lesson-thumbs/overrides.json

## Verification
