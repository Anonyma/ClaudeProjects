  "article": "## The Architecture of Skepticism\n\nSomething strange happened to truth in the second half of the twentieth century. It didn't disappear exactly—truth remained a word people used constantly—but it began to feel different. Slipperier. More contested. Where once there had been confident proclamations about how the world worked, there emerged instead a kind of vertigo, a sense that the ground beneath our feet was not as solid as we had been taught to believe.\n\nThis philosophical earthquake registered in unexpected places. It showed up in buildings that looked like frozen explosions, in artworks that were perfect copies of nothing, in academic papers that questioned whether anything could be known at all. But perhaps most consequentially, it emerged in the way entire societies began to relate to information itself—a transformation that has culminated in what many now call the \"post-truth era.\"\n\nTo understand how we arrived at a moment where \"alternative facts\" can be uttered with a straight face, where deepfakes threaten the evidentiary value of video footage, and where algorithmic filter bubbles create incompatible realities for people living in the same cities, we must trace a line backward through deconstructivist architecture, postmodern art, and French philosophy to a fundamental crisis of confidence that began in the ruins of the Second World War.\n\n## The Modernist Dream and Its Discontents\n\nBefore the skepticism, there was certainty. The modernist project—that great enterprise of the Enlightenment extended into the twentieth century—rested on bedrock convictions about reason, progress, and universal truth.\n\nIn architecture, this manifested as the International Style: glass boxes of crystalline purity, buildings that embodied the dictum \"form follows function.\" Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in Manhattan, completed in 1958, stands as perhaps the purest expression of this ethos—a bronze-tinted tower of such austere elegance that it seems to exist as pure geometry made material. \"Less is more,\" Mies famously declared, and in that aphorism lay an entire worldview: the belief that by stripping away ornament, tradition, and local particularity, architects could arrive at universal solutions to human dwelling.\n\nLe Corbusier, whose influence on twentieth-century architecture rivals any figure's, went further. \"A house is a machine for living in,\" he proclaimed, and his designs reflected a confidence that the optimal forms for human habitation could be rationally determined and universally applied. His Unité d'habitation in Marseille, completed in 1952, was conceived as a \"vertical city\"—a self-contained ecosystem with shops, a kindergarten, and a swimming pool, all housed within a single concrete structure raised on pilotis.\n\nThis architectural confidence reflected deeper assumptions:\n\n| Modernist Belief | Underlying Premise |\n|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Universal design solutions exist | Human needs are fundamentally the same across cultures |\n| Rational planning improves lives | Experts can determine optimal social arrangements |\n| Progress is linear and achievable | History moves toward better futures |\n| Truth is discoverable through reason | Objective reality can be known |\n| Form should follow function | Meaning is inherent, not constructed |\n\nBut by the 1960s, cracks had appeared in this edifice of certainty. Two world wars had demonstrated that technological progress could serve destruction as readily as liberation. The atomic bomb—that triumph of scientific rationality—had introduced the possibility of species-level extinction. Colonial liberation movements challenged the universality of Western values. And in philosophy, a group of French thinkers began developing tools for dismantling the very foundations of modernist confidence.\n\n## The French Dismantlers: Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida\n\n### Jean-François Lyotard and the Death of Grand Narratives\n\nIn 1979, the philosopher Jean-François Lyotard published a report originally commissioned by the government of Quebec on the state of knowledge in computerized societies. Its title was \"The Postmodern Condition,\" and its influence far exceeded any bureaucratic document's normal reach.\n\nLyotard's central claim was deceptively simple: postmodernity could be defined as \"incredulity toward metanarratives.\" But unpacked, this statement contained explosive implications.\n\n> A metanarrative—or grand narrative—is a totalizing story that legitimizes knowledge and social arrangements. The Enlightenment narrative of progress through reason. The Marxist narrative of class struggle moving toward human emancipation. The Christian narrative of fall and redemption. These are the stories we tell ourselves to explain why things are the way they are and to justify our institutions.\n\nLyotard argued that in the postmodern condition, these grand narratives had lost their credibility. After Auschwitz, after the Gulag, after Hiroshima, who could believe in the inevitable march of progress? The great legitimating stories had failed to deliver on their promises, and their failure had created a crisis of legitimation.\n\nWhat remained, in Lyotard's analysis, was a landscape of \"petits récits\"—little narratives, local and contingent, making no claim to universal truth. Knowledge became fragmented, contextual, valid here but not necessarily there, now but not necessarily then.\n\nPerhaps most prescient was Lyotard's observation about the \"mercantilization of knowledge.\" In the postmodern era, he argued, knowledge would be valued not for its truth but for its performativity—its efficiency within systems of production and exchange. The question \"Is it true?\" would give way to \"Is it useful?\" and \"Is it salable?\" Four decades before the attention economy and algorithmic content optimization, Lyotard had diagnosed the transformation of information into commodity.\n\n### Michel Foucault: Truth as Power\n\nIf Lyotard questioned the stories, Michel Foucault questioned the storytellers. His life's work constituted a sustained investigation into the relationship between knowledge and power—a relationship he argued was not incidental but constitutive.\n\nFoucault's insight was that what counts as \"true\" in any society is not simply discovered but produced. The procedures by which truth is established—the methods, institutions, credentials, and discourses that separate legitimate knowledge from mere opinion—are themselves exercises of power. \"Truth,\" Foucault wrote, \"is linked in a circular relation with systems of power which produce and sustain it.\"\n\nThis did not mean, as his critics sometimes claimed, that Foucault believed truth was simply whatever the powerful said it was. His point was subtler and more troubling: the very frameworks through which we distinguish truth from falsehood are not neutral tools but are themselves shaped by and implicated in relations of power.\n\nConsider his concept of the **Panopticon**. Originally designed by the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the eighteenth century as an ideal prison, the Panopticon was a circular structure with a central watchtower from which guards could observe all prisoners without themselves being seen. The prisoners, never knowing when they were being watched, would internalize surveillance and regulate their own behavior.\n\nFoucault used this architectural design as a metaphor for modern disciplinary society. Schools, hospitals, factories, and institutions of all kinds, he argued, operated through similar mechanisms of visibility and normalization. We are trained to monitor ourselves, to conform to norms we experience as natural but which are in fact historically contingent productions of power.\n\n> \"Visibility is a trap,\" Foucault wrote. In an age of ubiquitous surveillance cameras, social media self-presentation, and algorithmic profiling, this observation has acquired an almost unbearable prescience.\n\n### Jacques Derrida: The Instability of Meaning\n\nThe third figure in this philosophical triumvirate, Jacques Derrida, directed his skepticism at language itself. His method, which he called \"deconstruction,\" aimed to reveal the instabilities hidden within texts and concepts that present themselves as stable.\n\nDerrida observed that Western thought has traditionally organized itself through binary oppositions: presence/absence, speech/writing, reason/emotion, nature/culture, male/female. In each pair, one term is privileged as primary, pure, or foundational, while the other is treated as derivative, contaminated, or secondary.\n\nBut Derrida demonstrated that these hierarchies could not sustain themselves upon examination. The privileged term always depended on its subordinate for definition; the pure was always already contaminated by what it excluded. Through patient textual analysis, Derrida showed how the suppressed term would return to unsettle the certainties built upon its exclusion.\n\nHis concept of **différance**—a neologism that in French suggests both \"to differ\" and \"to defer\"—captured the essential instability of meaning. When we look up a word in a dictionary, we find other words. Those words are defined by still other words. Meaning is always deferred, never fully present. Language is a system of differences without positive terms.\n\nThe implications for any claim to final truth were profound. If meaning is always slipping away, always dependent on contexts that themselves shift, then the dream of a fixed foundation for knowledge—whether in reason, experience, or revelation—must be abandoned.\n\n## Building Skepticism: From Venturi to the Deconstructivists\n\n### Robert Venturi and the Decorated Shed\n\nThe philosophical dismantling of modernist certainty found its architectural counterpart in the work of Robert Venturi. His 1966 book \"Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture\" was a direct assault on modernist orthodoxy.\n\n\"I like elements which are hybrid rather than 'pure,'\" Venturi declared, \"compromising rather than 'clean,' distorted rather than 'straightforward.'\" Where Mies had proclaimed \"Less is more,\" Venturi responded: \"Less is a bore.\"\n\nVenturi's argument was not merely aesthetic. He was challenging the modernist assumption that architecture could achieve universal, timeless solutions by eliminating context, history, and ornament. Real buildings, he insisted, existed in real places with real histories and were used by real people with their messy, contradictory desires.\n\nIn 1972, Venturi, along with Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour, published \"Learning from Las Vegas,\" documenting their study of the Las Vegas Strip with a scholarly seriousness usually reserved for ancient Rome. Where modernists saw vulgar commercial chaos, Venturi and his colleagues found a vital architecture of communication—buildings that spoke to people driving by at forty miles per hour.\n\nThey distinguished between two types of buildings:\n\n- **The Duck**: A building where the form itself is the symbol (like a restaurant shaped like a duck)\n- **The Decorated Shed**: A conventional structure with signs and symbols applied to communicate meaning\n\nThe Las Vegas casino, they argued, was an honest decorated shed—a functional box that made no pretense of being anything other than what it was, using signs to communicate with its audience. The modernist glass box, by contrast, was a duck pretending not to be one—a building whose form was saturated with symbolic meaning (progress, rationality, universality) while claiming to be purely functional.\n\n### The MoMA Exhibition and Deconstructivist Architecture\n\nIf Venturi's postmodernism introduced historical reference and ironic play into architecture, deconstructivism took the philosophical assault further, attacking the very geometry and stability of buildings themselves.\n\nThe movement crystallized around a 1988 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art titled \"Deconstructivist Architecture,\" curated by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley. The show featured seven architects whose work shared a common sensibility: Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, Rem Koolhaas, Peter Eisenman, Zaha Hadid, Bernard Tschumi, and Coop Himmelb(l)au.\n\nWhat united these diverse practices was an approach to form that seemed to violate architecture's fundamental promise of shelter and stability. These buildings looked unstable, fragmented, as if caught in the moment of explosion or collapse. Walls tilted at disorienting angles. Floors sloped. Windows appeared to have been placed at random. The experience of inhabiting these spaces was one of productive discomfort—a physical manifestation of the philosophical unease that Derrida's texts produced in readers.\n\nThe connection to Derrida was not incidental. Peter Eisenman, one of the movement's leading figures, collaborated directly with the philosopher on a project for the Parc de la Villette in Paris. Their work together, documented in the book \"Chora L Works,\" attempted to translate deconstruction from text to building—to construct absence, to build the unstable.\n\nThe collaboration was fraught with productive misunderstanding. Eisenman needed materiality; buildings must stand up. Derrida worked in the realm of text, where paradox could be sustained indefinitely. The gap between philosophical concept and physical construction proved irreducible—which was, in a sense, precisely Derrida's point about the impossibility of perfect translation.\n\n### Bernard Tschumi and the Architecture of Event\n\nBernard Tschumi's design for the Parc de la Villette, completed in 1987, represented one of the clearest attempts to realize deconstructivist principles at urban scale. Across the park, Tschumi distributed a series of bright red steel structures he called \"folies\"—a term borrowed from the decorative garden buildings of the eighteenth century.\n\nBut these were follies in more than one sense. They had no fixed function. They were not shelters in any conventional sense. They looked like fragments of industrial machinery—cranes, derricks, processing equipment—scattered across the landscape as if by some explosion.\n\nTschumi's argument was that architecture should not be about stable forms but about events—about what happens in and around buildings. Space was not a container for predetermined activities but a stage for unpredictable occurrences. The architect's role was not to determine how spaces would be used but to create conditions of possibility.\n\n### Frank Gehry and the Mainstreaming of Fragmentation\n\nIf deconstructivism began as an elite philosophical exercise, it achieved mainstream visibility through one building above all: Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, which opened in 1997.\n\nThe building defies description in conventional architectural terms. It has no discernible front or back. Its surfaces curve and fold in ways that seem to deny the rectilinear logic of construction. Clad in titanium panels that shimmer and shift with changing light, it appears less built than grown—or perhaps crashed, like some vessel from an alien geometry.\n\nThe Guggenheim Bilbao was only possible because of advances in computer-aided design. Gehry's office used CATIA software, originally developed for aerospace applications, to model and engineer curves that would have been impossible to calculate by hand. The building thus represents a peculiar conjunction: radical formal experimentation enabled by the most advanced rationalist tools.\n\nIts success was phenomenal. The \"Bilbao effect\" became shorthand for the ability of spectacular architecture to transform urban economies through cultural tourism. Cities around the world commissioned their own titanium gestures, hoping to replicate the magic.\n\nBut the Guggenheim Bilbao also represented a certain domestication of deconstructivist principles. Where early deconstructivist work aimed at productive discomfort—at making the familiar strange—Gehry's museum offered something more like sublime spectacle. The fragmentation was beautiful rather than troubling, exhilarating rather than destabilizing.\n\n## The Art of Shimmering Emptiness\n\nThe philosophical currents that produced deconstructivist architecture also transformed the art world, though through different mechanisms. Where architects shattered form, artists attacked the concepts of originality, authenticity, and the stable self.\n\n### Jeff Koons and the Simulacrum\n\nNo artist better embodies postmodern art's relationship to consumer culture than Jeff Koons. His signature works—monumental stainless steel sculptures that replicate cheap, mass-produced objects with flawless precision—pose fundamental questions about value, authenticity, and the nature of art itself.\n\nConsider \"Rabbit\" (1986), a three-foot-tall sculpture of an inflatable toy bunny rendered in mirror-polished stainless steel. In 2019, it sold at auction for $91.1 million, setting a record for a living artist.\n\nWhat exactly did the buyer purchase? Not the object itself, which is a copy of something that was never an original—a mass-produced novelty item with no authentic prototype. Not craftsmanship, since Koons does not fabricate his own work but directs teams of assistants. Not rarity, since the piece exists in an edition of three plus one artist's proof.\n\nThe philosopher Jean Baudrillard provides a framework for understanding Koons's work through the concept of the **simulacrum**—a copy without an original. In Baudrillard's analysis, we have moved through historical stages in the relationship between representation and reality:\n\n1. **The image reflects a basic reality** (the map represents the territory)\n2. **The image masks and perverts reality** (ideology distorts truth)\n3. **The image masks the absence of reality** (spectacle substitutes for substance)\n4. **The image bears no relation to any reality whatsoever** (pure simulation)\n\nKoons's mirror-polished surfaces literalize this final stage. You look at \"Rabbit\" and see only your own reflection in its perfect surface—a reflection of a reflection, endlessly deferred meaning, shimmering emptiness.\n\n### Cindy Sherman and the Constructed Self\n\nIf Koons deconstructs the object, Cindy Sherman deconstructs the subject. Her \"Untitled Film Stills\" series (1977-1980) consists of sixty-nine black-and-white photographs in which Sherman poses as various female types from 1950s and 1960s B-movies: the femme fatale, the ingenue, the working girl, the suburban housewife.\n\nBut these are not actual film stills. They are simulations—perfect reproductions of something that never existed. Sherman is simultaneously the photographer, director, and subject, playing roles that are themselves constructed from media images.\n\nThe work demonstrates that femininity—and by extension, all identity—is not a natural essence but a performance. We learn how to be women or men not from some inner truth but from the images we consume: advertisements, movies, social media feeds. The self is not a stable core that expresses itself but a repertoire of roles we learn to play.\n\n> \"Which character am I playing today?\" This is not a question about authenticity but a recognition that authenticity itself is a role.\n\n## The Hyperreal Present: Filter Bubbles and the Post-Truth Era\n\nThe philosophical and artistic developments of the late twentieth century have found their fullest realization—and their darkest applications—in the digital age. The concepts that once seemed abstruse academic concerns have become lived experience for billions of people.\n\n### Baudrillard's Prophecy Fulfilled\n\nBaudrillard argued that we had entered an age of **hyperreality**, in which simulation had become more real than reality itself. Consider:\n\n- Reality television, which is neither reality nor traditional television but a hybrid that viewers experience as a valid form of the real\n- Social media personas, carefully curated performances that may feel more authentic to their creators than face-to-face interactions\n- The 2012 Coachella appearance of a holographic Tupac Shakur, a dead performer resurrected through technology, performing \"live\" to a cheering crowd\n\nDisneyland, Baudrillard famously argued, exists to make us believe that the rest of America is real. But in fact, he suggested, Los Angeles is no less a construction than the theme park—just less honest about its artificiality.\n\n### The Fragmentation of Shared Reality\n\nLyotard's analysis of the fragmentation of knowledge has been realized at scale through algorithmic content curation. Social media platforms, designed to maximize engagement, create what sociologists call **filter bubbles** or **echo chambers**—informational environments tailored to individual preferences and increasingly disconnected from any shared frame of reference.\n\nThe result is what might be called **tribal epistemology**: different groups not merely disagreeing about facts but operating with incompatible criteria for what counts as evidence, what sources are credible, and what methods can establish truth.\n\n| Traditional Epistemology | Tribal Epistemology |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Shared standards of evidence | Group-specific criteria |\n| Expert credibility based on credentials | Credibility based on tribal affiliation |\n| Facts can settle disputes | Facts are themselves contested |\n| Reality is singular | Multiple realities coexist |\n\nFlat-earthers can live next door to quantum physicists, each convinced their worldview is validated by evidence, each receiving constant confirmation from their algorithmically curated feeds.\n\n### Deepfakes and the Death of Evidence\n\nThe emergence of AI-generated synthetic media—deepfakes—represents perhaps the ultimate challenge to evidentiary truth. For most of human history, photographs and video recordings served as relatively reliable documentation. \"Seeing is believing\" expressed a reasonable confidence that visual evidence corresponded to events that actually occurred.\n\nDeepfake technology dissolves this confidence. When any video can be fabricated with increasing ease and decreasing detectability, the evidential value of all video is undermined. We enter what researchers call the **liar's dividend**: even authentic recordings can be dismissed as potentially fake.\n\nThis is not merely a technical problem solvable through better detection algorithms. It is a fundamental transformation in the epistemological status of visual evidence—one that the philosophers of postmodernism anticipated decades before the technology existed.\n\n### Foucault in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism\n\nFoucault's analysis of the Panopticon has acquired new relevance in an era when digital surveillance far exceeds anything Bentham could have imagined. We carry tracking devices in our pockets. Our browsing histories, purchase patterns, location data, and social connections are harvested, analyzed, and monetized.\n\nBut the contemporary Panopticon differs from Bentham's design in a crucial respect. Bentham's prisoners knew they were being watched; the purpose was to induce conscious self-regulation. Today's surveillance is largely invisible—built into the infrastructure of daily life in ways that render it unremarkable.\n\nMoreover, the watchman in the tower has been replaced by algorithms. These systems observe not to discipline but to predict and manipulate. They do not punish deviance; they anticipate and channel desire. The goal is not the docile body of Foucault's disciplinary society but the profitable consumer of surveillance capitalism.\n\n## The Way Forward: Metamodernism and Informed Earnestness\n\nIs there any escape from the hall of mirrors? Some contemporary thinkers have proposed **metamodernism** as a way beyond the impasse of postmodern skepticism without returning to naive modernist confidence.\n\nMetamodernism, as theorized by Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker, is characterized by oscillation between modernist enthusiasm and postmodern irony—a knowing sincerity that acknowledges construction while still building, that recognizes contingency while still committing.\n\n> The metamodern sensibility might be characterized as: \"We know that everything is constructed, that progress is not guaranteed, that grand narratives are dangerous. And we're going to try to build something beautiful and human anyway.\"\n\nThis is not a return to innocence but a movement forward that incorporates postmodern insights without being paralyzed by them. It recognizes that:\n\n- Truth claims are always partial and situated, yet truth still matters\n- All identities are constructed, yet we can construct identities worth inhabiting\n- Grand narratives have failed, yet we need stories to make sense of our lives\n- Power shapes knowledge, yet some knowledge claims are better supported than others\n\nThe challenge of our moment is not to choose between naive realism and cynical relativism but to develop what we might call **critical realism**: a commitment to truth-seeking that is informed by awareness of the obstacles to truth—including our own biases, the distortions of power, and the limitations of our frameworks.\n\n## Conclusion: Are We All Decorated Sheds?\n\nVenturi's concept of the decorated shed—a generic structure hiding behind a facade of signs and symbols—offers a disturbing metaphor for selfhood in the digital age. In an era of carefully curated social media profiles, personal branding, and performative authenticity, have we all become decorated sheds?\n\nThe question is not whether we construct our identities—postmodernism established that identity is always constructed. The question is what kind of structures we build and what kind of decorations we apply. Are we aware of the construction? Do we have any agency in it? Or are we merely vessels for the images and desires that flow through us, decorated by algorithms with symbols designed to maximize engagement?\n\nThe buildings that look like explosions, the art that reflects only the viewer's own image, the philosophy that questions every foundation—these were responses to a genuine crisis of confidence, a necessary dismantling of false certainties. But dismantling is not enough. At some point, one must inhabit something.\n\nPerhaps the task now is not to pretend we can return to the glass box of modernist certainty, nor to remain indefinitely in the exploded fragments of deconstruction, but to build something new from the rubble—structures that acknowledge their own constructedness, that make no claim to universal truth, yet still provide shelter.\n\nTruth, in this view, is not a foundation to be discovered but a practice to be maintained—a commitment to honest inquiry, openness to revision, and willingness to be corrected. It requires institutions, norms, and habits that support truth-seeking even in the face of the Foucauldian insight that power shapes what counts as true.\n\nThe question, finally, is not whether buildings explode or truth dissolves, but what we build after the explosion—and whether we can still tell the difference between structure and decoration, between ground and facade, between what we know and what we merely believe.",

    {
      "question": "What did Jean-François Lyotard mean by 'incredulity toward metanarratives'?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Skepticism toward small, local stories and personal experiences",
        "B": "Disbelief in the grand totalizing stories (progress, emancipation, salvation) that legitimate knowledge and society",
        "C": "Rejection of all forms of narrative and storytelling",
        "D": "Preference for scientific narratives over religious ones"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Lyotard defined the postmodern condition as 'incredulity toward metanarratives'—the grand stories like Enlightenment progress, Marxist emancipation, or religious salvation that previously legitimized knowledge and social arrangements. After the failures of the 20th century, these totalizing narratives lost credibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Michel Foucault characterize the relationship between power and knowledge?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Knowledge is neutral and power sometimes misuses it",
        "B": "Power corrupts knowledge, but pure knowledge exists independently",
        "C": "Truth is produced by power structures, not neutrally discovered",
        "D": "Knowledge always leads to democratic power distribution"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Foucault argued that knowledge and power are inextricably linked—truth is not neutrally discovered but produced through institutions, methods, and discourses that are themselves exercises of power. What counts as 'true' is shaped by the systems that establish and legitimize it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Baudrillard's concept of the 'simulacrum' as exemplified by Jeff Koons's art?",
      "options": {
        "A": "A perfect copy of an original masterpiece",
        "B": "A copy without an original—representation that bears no relation to any reality",
        "C": "A damaged or degraded reproduction",
        "D": "A parody that mocks the original"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Baudrillard's simulacrum is a copy without an original. Koons's 'Rabbit' exemplifies this—it's a perfect steel copy of a mass-produced balloon toy, but that toy itself was never an 'original' work. The art reflects only the viewer's own image in its polished surface, meaning infinitely deferred."

    {
      "question": "Why could Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao only be built with computer technology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "The city government required digital planning approval",
        "B": "Traditional construction workers refused to build it",
        "C": "Its complex curves were impossible to calculate and engineer without aerospace design software (CATIA)",
        "D": "The titanium cladding could only be manufactured by computerized machines"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Gehry's office used CATIA software, originally developed for aerospace applications, to model and engineer the building's flowing curves and complex geometry. These forms would have been mathematically impossible to calculate by hand, representing a conjunction of radical form and advanced rationalist tools."

      "question": "What is the 'liar's dividend' created by deepfake technology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Financial profits from creating fake videos",
        "B": "The ability to dismiss authentic recordings as potentially fabricated",
        "C": "Tax benefits for AI research companies",
        "D": "Increased advertising revenue on social media"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'liar's dividend' refers to how the existence of deepfake technology undermines all visual evidence. Even when video is authentic, it can now be dismissed as potentially fake. This transforms the epistemological status of visual documentation—'seeing is believing' no longer holds."
