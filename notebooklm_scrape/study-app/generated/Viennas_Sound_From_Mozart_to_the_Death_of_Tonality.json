  "article": "# Vienna's Sound: From Mozart to the Death of Tonality\n\n## Introduction: Why Vienna Became the Music Capital\n\nFor roughly 150 years—from the 1780s to the 1920s—if you wanted to make it as a serious composer, you went to **Vienna**.\n\nNot Paris (though it had opera). Not London (though it had audiences). Not Berlin (though it had resources). **Vienna**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Vienna developed a unique **musical ecosystem** that no other city could match:\n\n1. **Aristocratic patronage**: Wealthy nobles competed to hire the best composers and maintain private orchestras\n2. **Imperial institutions**: Court Opera and Burgtheater needed constant new works\n3. **Coffeehouse culture**: Musicians, composers, critics, and patrons met informally to network and argue\n4. **Critical mass**: Once Vienna became the center, the best musicians migrated there, creating a self-reinforcing cycle\n5. **Audience sophistication**: Viennese audiences were educated, demanding, and willing to support experimental work (within limits)\n\nThis essay traces the arc of Vienna's musical dominance—from Haydn and Mozart perfecting Classical form, through Beethoven's revolution, to Schoenberg's destruction of tonality itself.\n\nIt's a story about how one city created the grammar of Western music—and then demolished it.\n\n---\n\n## The Classical Perfection: Haydn and Mozart (1780s-1790s)\n\n### Haydn: The Architect\n\nJoseph Haydn (1732-1809) didn't live in Vienna most of his career—he was employed by the Esterházy family, Hungarian aristocrats with a palace 50km east of Vienna.\n\nBut his work defined **Classical style**: clarity, balance, formal elegance.\n\nHaydn essentially **invented the string quartet** (four-movement form for two violins, viola, cello) and the **Classical symphony** (four-movement orchestral work with specific formal structures).\n\nHe wrote:\n- **104 symphonies**\n- **68 string quartets**\n- **Numerous operas, masses, piano sonatas**\n\nHis late works—the **London Symphonies** (Nos. 93-104, 1791-1795)—were international hits. He visited London twice, was treated like a celebrity.\n\nWhy does Haydn matter?\n\nBecause he created the **templates**. The sonata form (exposition, development, recapitulation). The symphony's four-movement structure (fast, slow, minuet, fast). The way themes are developed and transformed.\n\nEveryone after Haydn was either following his templates or reacting against them.\n\n### Mozart: The Genius\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) moved to Vienna in 1781 (age 25) after a disastrous job-hunting tour of Europe. He spent his last decade there, freelancing—teaching, performing, composing on commission.\n\nMozart's Vienna years produced:\n- **The Marriage of Figaro** (1786): opera about servants outsmarting aristocrats (revolutionary subtext)\n- **Don Giovanni** (1787): opera about a serial seducer dragged to hell\n- **The Magic Flute** (1791): Masonic allegory with spectacular vocal writing\n- **His last symphonies** (especially No. 40 in G minor, No. 41 "Jupiter")\n- **Piano concertos** that are essentially conversations between soloist and orchestra\n- **String quartets** dedicated to Haydn\n\nMozart took Haydn's forms and filled them with **expressive depth** Haydn never attempted. His music has:\n- **Chromaticism** (notes outside the key) creating emotional ambiguity\n- **Operatic drama** even in instrumental works\n- **Harmonic surprises** that still feel fresh 200+ years later\n\nMozart died in 1791 at age 35, poor and overworked. His funeral was barely attended. His burial site is unknown (he was buried in a common grave).\n\nOnly later did Vienna realize what it had lost.\n\n### What They Created: The Classical Language\n\nHaydn and Mozart together established what we call **Classical style**:\n\n- **Tonality**: Every piece is in a key (C major, D minor, etc.) and follows harmonic progressions that create tension and resolution\n- **Form**: Sonata form, theme and variations, rondo—templates that create expectation and surprise\n- **Balance**: Symmetrical phrases, clear structure, nothing excessive\n- **Development**: Taking a musical idea and transforming it, exploring its possibilities\n\nThis was the **grammar of Western music** for the next 100+ years.\n\nEven when Romanticism made music more emotional and programmatic, it still used Classical structures.\n\nUntil Schoenberg destroyed them.\n\n---\n\n## Beethoven: The Revolutionary Who Preserved Tonality (1792-1827)\n\n### Arrival in Vienna\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) arrived in Vienna from Bonn in November 1792, age 21. His goal: study with Haydn.\n\nThe lessons didn't go well—Beethoven found Haydn too old-fashioned, Haydn found Beethoven arrogant. But Beethoven stayed in Vienna the rest of his life.\n\nWhy Vienna? Because it was the only city where a freelance composer could survive. Beethoven:\n- Performed as piano virtuoso\n- Published compositions (sold to aristocratic patrons and publishers)\n- Received commissions\n- Eventually secured annuities from aristocratic patrons (guaranteed income)\n\nHe never had a salaried court position (like Haydn with the Esterházys). He was the first fully **freelance** composer of the first rank.\n\n### The Three Periods\n\nBeethoven's career is traditionally divided into three periods:\n\n#### Early Period (1792-1802): Learning the Rules\n\nFirst two symphonies, early piano sonatas, string quartets.\n\nThis is Beethoven working within Classical forms—Haydn and Mozart's grammar—but already showing his personality: more aggressive, more dynamic, more contrast.\n\n#### Middle Period (1803-1814): The Heroic Style\n\nThis is peak Beethoven:\n\n**Symphony No. 3 "Eroica"** (1803): Originally dedicated to Napoleon (Beethoven tore up the dedication when Napoleon crowned himself emperor). First movement alone is longer than entire Mozart symphonies. Introduces **heroic struggle** as symphonic theme.\n\n**Symphony No. 5** (1808): The famous "fate knocking at the door" motif (da-da-da-DUM). Entire symphony built from this four-note cell—obsessive development.\n\n**Symphony No. 6 "Pastoral"** (1808): Program music—five movements depicting countryside, brook, thunderstorm.\n\n**Symphony No. 9** (1824): Adds chorus and soloists in final movement (setting Schiller's \"Ode to Joy\"). First time a major symphony used voices.\n\n**Fidelio** (1805, revised 1814): His only opera. About a wife rescuing her husband from political imprisonment. Very idealistic.\n\n**Piano sonatas**: \"Waldstein,\" \"Appassionata,\" \"Les Adieux\"—expanding piano technique and emotional range.\n\nThis period coincides with Beethoven's **deafness**. By 1802 he was noticeably deaf. By 1814 he couldn't hear conversation. By 1818 he was totally deaf.\n\nHe kept composing.\n\n#### Late Period (1815-1827): The Transcendent\n\nBy now Beethoven was isolated—deaf, never married, difficult personality. His music became **inward, mystical, structurally radical**.\n\n**Late string quartets** (Opp. 127, 130, 131, 132, 135): These are some of the strangest music of the 19th century. Movements that seem to float outside time. Fugues (old Baroque technique) inserted into Classical forms. Emotional extremes.\n\nThe **Grosse Fuge** (Great Fugue), originally the finale of Op. 130, was so violent and difficult that Beethoven's publisher begged him to replace it (he did, but published the fugue separately).\n\n**Missa Solemnis** (1823): Massive Catholic mass, more symphonic than liturgical.\n\nBeethoven died in 1827. His funeral procession drew 20,000 people—Vienna had finally recognized his greatness.\n\n### What Beethoven Changed\n\nBeethoven **revolutionized music without destroying tonality**.\n\nHe expanded:\n- **Scale**: Symphonies got longer, more complex\n- **Emotional range**: Music could express struggle, triumph, tragedy, transcendence\n- **Development**: Taking a tiny motif and building an entire movement\n- **Structural freedom**: Adding movements, breaking formal rules when necessary\n\nBut he **preserved harmonic grammar**. Even the Grosse Fuge is in B-flat major. It's violent and dissonant, but it's still **tonal**—it has a key, it resolves.\n\nSchoenberg would later say: Beethoven showed us how to develop ideas. But he didn't break the harmonic system. That was my job.\n\n---\n\n## Schubert: The Lied and Romantic Interiority (1797-1828)\n\n### The Outsider\n\nFranz Schubert (1797-1828) was Viennese-born, unlike Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven (all immigrants).\n\nHe never had Beethoven's international fame. He made almost no money. He lived in friends' apartments, scraping by on small commissions and publication sales.\n\nHe died at **31**—probably from complications of syphilis—in 1828, a year after Beethoven.\n\nMost of his music wasn't published or performed during his lifetime.\n\n### The Lied (Art Song)\n\nSchubert's greatest innovation: the **Lied** (German art song)—a setting of poetry for voice and piano.\n\nHe wrote **over 600 songs**.\n\nExamples:\n- **\"Erlkönig\"** (Erlking, 1815): Goethe poem about Death seducing a child. Piano gallops like a horse. Four characters (narrator, father, child, Erlking) sung by one voice.\n- **\"Gretchen am Spinnrade\"** (Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel, 1814): Piano imitates spinning wheel while Gretchen (from Goethe's *Faust*) sings about her seducer.\n- **Song cycles**: *Die schöne Müllerin* (The Beautiful Mill-Girl), *Winterreise* (Winter Journey)—narratives told through sequences of songs.\n\nThe Lied became a major Romantic genre. Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, Mahler all wrote song cycles inspired by Schubert.\n\n### Chamber Music and Symphonies\n\nSchubert also wrote:\n- **String quartets** (especially \"Death and the Maiden\")\n- **Piano trios**\n- **\"Trout\" Quintet** (for piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass)\n- **Symphonies**: His **Symphony No. 8 \"Unfinished\"** (only two movements completed) is hauntingly incomplete. His **Symphony No. 9 \"Great\"** is Beethovenian in scale but more lyrical.\n\nSchubert's music is **Romantic** in character—emotionally direct, often melancholic—but still uses Classical forms.\n\n### Posthumous Fame\n\nSchubert's music was rediscovered decades after his death. Schumann found manuscripts of symphonies in the 1830s. The Unfinished Symphony wasn't premiered until 1865 (37 years after Schubert's death).\n\nBy the late 19th century, Schubert was recognized as a Romantic genius—the inventor of a whole genre (Lied) and a master of lyrical melody.\n\n---\n\n## The Brahms vs. Wagner Split: Two Paths for Music\n\n### Johannes Brahms: Defending Classical Form (1833-1897)\n\nJohannes Brahms moved to Vienna in 1862 (age 29) and stayed the rest of his life.\n\nHe was seen as Beethoven's heir—the defender of **absolute music** (music without extra-musical narrative) and **Classical forms**.\n\nBrahms wrote:\n- **Four symphonies**: Carefully constructed, using sonata form and development like Beethoven\n- **Concertos**: Two for piano, one for violin, one for violin and cello\n- **Chamber music**: String quartets, piano trios, clarinet quintet\n- **German Requiem**: A non-liturgical choral work using German texts (not Latin)\n\nBrahms was **obsessively self-critical**. He destroyed early compositions he judged unworthy. He waited until age 43 to publish his Symphony No. 1 because he felt Beethoven's shadow.\n\nCritic Eduard Hanslick championed Brahms as the antidote to Wagner's excesses.\n\n### Richard Wagner: The Revolutionary (1813-1883)\n\nWagner didn't live in Vienna (he was based in Bayreuth, Bavaria), but his influence on Viennese music was enormous.\n\nWagner's innovations:\n- **Gesamtkunstwerk** (total artwork): Opera fusing music, drama, visual design\n- **Leitmotifs**: Musical themes associated with characters, objects, ideas\n- **Endless melody**: No clear phrase endings, continuous flow\n- **Chromaticism**: Pushing tonality to its limits (but not breaking it)\n\nHis opera **Tristan und Isolde** (1865) opens with the famous **\"Tristan chord\"**—an unresolved dissonance that seems to float outside tonality. It doesn't resolve for hours.\n\nWagner's **Ring Cycle** (four operas, 15+ hours) was an industrial-scale music drama about gods, heroes, and the end of the world.\n\nHis music was **maximalist**: huge orchestras, long durations, emotional overwhelm.\n\n### The Battle: Absolute vs. Program Music\n\nThe Brahms-Wagner split represented two visions for music's future:\n\n**Brahms camp**: Music is **abstract structure**. It doesn't need stories or programs. A symphony should stand on its own formal logic.\n\n**Wagner camp**: Music is **dramatic expression**. It should tell stories, depict emotions, integrate with theater.\n\nThis wasn't just aesthetic—it was political. Brahms represented conservative, Classical values. Wagner represented Romantic nationalism and revolutionary change.\n\nVienna became a battleground. Critics took sides. Audiences split.\n\n---\n\n## Mahler: The End of Romanticism (1860-1911)\n\n### The Conductor-Composer\n\nGustav Mahler (1860-1911) was the director of the Vienna Court Opera (1897-1907)—the most prestigious conducting position in the world.\n\nBut he was also a composer—and his symphonies were too weird, too long, too demanding for most audiences.\n\nHe composed in summers, during breaks from conducting. His symphonies are:\n- **Massive in scale**: 60-90 minutes, requiring huge orchestras (Symphony No. 8 \"Symphony of a Thousand\" needs 1,000+ performers)\n- **Obsessed with death**: Funeral marches, songs about dead children, apocalyptic visions\n- **Programmatic but abstract**: Some have texts or programs, but the music goes beyond narrative\n\n### The Symphonies\n\nEach Mahler symphony is a **cosmic journey**:\n\n**Symphony No. 1**: Youthful exuberance turning into struggle\n\n**Symphony No. 2 \"Resurrection\"**: Ends with choral finale about resurrection—but it's unclear if Mahler believes it\n\n**Symphony No. 3**: Longest standard-repertoire symphony (90-100 minutes), moving from chaos to transcendence\n\n**Symphony No. 4**: Ends with soprano singing a child's vision of heaven\n\n**Symphony No. 5**: Starts with a funeral march, ends with massive fugue\n\n**Symphony No. 6 \"Tragic\"**: Ends in defeat—three hammer blows of fate crush the hero\n\n**Symphony No. 7**: Strange, nocturnal, hard to interpret\n\n**Symphony No. 8 \"Symphony of a Thousand\"**: Two-part choral symphony—Part I is Latin hymn, Part II is Goethe's *Faust*\n\n**Symphony No. 9**: Mahler's farewell to life. Final movement fades into silence like a dying breath. He knew he was dying (heart disease).\n\n**Symphony No. 10**: Unfinished (Mahler died 1911). Performing versions exist.\n\n### Tonality Under Pressure\n\nMahler's music is **tonal**—but barely.\n\nHe uses:\n- **Extreme chromaticism**: Notes outside the key create ambiguity\n- **Unresolved dissonances**: Tension without release\n- **Collage technique**: Quoting folk tunes, marches, waltzes—then distorting them\n\nYou can feel the **tonal system straining**. Mahler is testing how much dissonance, how much ambiguity, tonality can handle.\n\nSchoenberg said: \"After Mahler, I had no choice but to abandon tonality. He pushed it as far as it could go.\"\n\n### Why Death?\n\nWhy is Mahler obsessed with death?\n\n1. **Personal experience**: His daughter Maria died in 1907 (age 4). He was diagnosed with heart disease the same year.\n2. **Fin-de-siècle culture**: Living in Vienna during the empire's slow collapse, knowing the old world was ending.\n3. **Jewish outsider status**: Mahler converted to Catholicism to get the Opera job (Jews couldn't hold that position). But he was still seen as Jewish by antisemites. He was an **insider-outsider**—part of Viennese culture but also alienated.\n\nHis music sounds like someone **trying to find meaning in a godless universe**.\n\n---\n\n## Schoenberg: The Destruction of Tonality (1874-1951)\n\n### The Revolutionary\n\nArnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) was born in Vienna, studied with Alexander Zemlinsky, and became Mahler's protégé.\n\nHis early works—like **Verklärte Nacht** (Transfigured Night, 1899) for string sextet—are ultra-Romantic, ultra-chromatic, but still **tonal**.\n\nBut between **1908-1912**, Schoenberg made the leap: he **abandoned tonality altogether**.\n\n### Atonal Works\n\n**Das Buch der hängenden Gärten** (The Book of the Hanging Gardens, 1909): Song cycle with no key center.\n\n**Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11** (1909): First atonal piano works.\n\n**Erwartung** (Expectation, 1909): One-act opera, 30 minutes, one character (a woman) searching for her lover in a forest. She finds his corpse. The music is **pure anxiety**—no harmonic resolution, no rest.\n\n**Pierrot Lunaire** (1912): For soprano and chamber ensemble. Soprano uses **Sprechstimme** (speech-song)—halfway between speaking and singing. The text (translated from French) is surreal, dark, violent.\n\nListening to atonal Schoenberg feels like **falling**. There's no tonal \"home\" to return to. No resolution. Just endless dissonance.\n\n### Why Did He Do It?\n\nSchoenberg's explanation: **\"Tonality was exhausted.\"**\n\nAfter Wagner's Tristan chord, after Mahler's extreme chromaticism, tonality had been pushed to the limit. You could either:\n1. Keep repeating what Brahms and Mahler did (stale)\n2. Destroy the system and start over\n\nSchoenberg chose destruction.\n\nHe later compared it to Freud: \"Freud revealed the unconscious beneath the rational mind. I revealed the **atonal beneath the tonal**—music's unconscious.\"\n\n### The Twelve-Tone Technique (1920s)\n\nAfter a decade of \"free atonality,\" Schoenberg developed a **system**: the **twelve-tone technique** (also called serialism).\n\nRules:\n1. All twelve notes of the chromatic scale are **equal** (no hierarchy)\n2. Create a **tone row** (a specific ordering of the 12 notes)\n3. Use this row (and its inversions, retrogrades, transpositions) throughout the piece\n4. Never repeat a note until all 12 have been used\n\nThis was \"democracy\" applied to music—no note is more important than another.\n\nBut it made music **cerebral, difficult, cold**. Audiences hated it.\n\n### The Riot\n\nIn 1913, a concert of works by Schoenberg and his students (Berg, Webern) caused a **riot** in Vienna. Audience members shouted, threw objects, fought each other.\n\nSchoenberg's music violated everything Viennese audiences expected: melody, harmony, beauty.\n\nCritic: \"This isn't music. It's organized noise.\"\n\nSchoenberg: \"In 50 years, audiences will understand.\"\n\nHe was partially right. By the 1960s-70s, Schoenberg's music was studied in every conservatory—but it never became popular.\n\n---\n\n## The Viennese Ecosystem: Why This Happened Here\n\n### 1. Aristocratic Patronage\n\nVienna's aristocracy—Esterházys, Lobkowitzes, Lichnowskys—competed to hire composers and maintain private orchestras. This created **demand** and **financial support**.\n\n### 2. Imperial Institutions\n\nThe Court Opera and Burgtheater needed constant new works. This created **employment** for composers and **performance opportunities**.\n\n### 3. Coffeehouse Culture\n\nCafé Central, Café Landtmann, Café Museum—places where musicians, composers, critics, and philosophers met. Ideas cross-pollinated.\n\nSchoenberg might overhear Freud discussing dreams. Mahler might argue with Klimt about art. This **intellectual cross-fertilization** was uniquely Viennese.\n\n### 4. Competitive Environment\n\nBecause Vienna was the center, the **best musicians congregated**. This created competition—you had to be excellent just to survive.\n\n### 5. Audience Sophistication\n\nViennese audiences knew music. They recognized when a composer was quoting Haydn or subverting Beethoven. This created **pressure to innovate**.\n\n### 6. Fin-de-Siècle Anxiety\n\nLiving in a dying empire—knowing the old world was ending but not what would replace it—drove artists toward **apocalyptic creativity**.\n\nMahler's obsession with death. Schoenberg's destruction of tonality. These weren't random—they reflected the **cultural moment**.\n\n---\n\n## 1914-1918: The End of Viennese Musical Dominance\n\nWorld War I destroyed Vienna's musical ecosystem:\n\n- **The Habsburg Empire collapsed** (1918)\n- **Aristocratic patronage evaporated** (noble fortunes destroyed)\n- **Composers fled**: Schoenberg moved to Berlin, then Los Angeles (fleeing Nazis, 1933)\n- **The avant-garde moved**: Paris (Stravinsky, \"Les Six\") and Berlin (Weill, Hindemith) became new centers\n\nVienna remained culturally important—the Opera and Philharmonic continued—but it was no longer **the** center.\n\nThe golden age was over.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Grammar and Its Destruction\n\nVienna gave Western music its **grammar**: tonality, sonata form, symphonic structure.\n\nHaydn and Mozart perfected it.\n\nBeethoven expanded it.\n\nBrahms defended it.\n\nWagner and Mahler pushed it to the breaking point.\n\nSchoenberg **destroyed** it.\n\nThis arc—from creation to perfection to exhaustion to destruction—took 150 years.\n\nAnd it could only have happened in Vienna.\n\nBecause only Vienna had the infrastructure, the patronage, the competitive environment, and the existential anxiety to produce both the **most perfect** and the **most radical** music in Western history.\n\nThe city that invented the rules also broke them.",

      "question": "What unique infrastructure made Vienna the uncontested music capital for 150 years?",
      "options": [
        "Government subsidies and state-controlled conservatories",
        "Aristocratic patronage (nobles competing to hire composers), imperial theaters (Opera, Burgtheater), coffeehouse networking culture, and critical mass of musicians",
        "Superior instrument manufacturing and acoustic engineering",
        "Large concert halls and recording technology"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Vienna's musical dominance came from specific infrastructure: wealthy aristocrats (Esterházys, Lobkowitzes) competed to hire composers and maintain private orchestras, creating demand and financial support. Imperial Court Opera and Burgtheater needed constant new works, creating employment. Coffeehouses (Café Central, Landtmann) enabled networking. Once Vienna became the center, the best musicians migrated there, creating self-reinforcing critical mass. This combination existed nowhere else."

    {
      "question": "How did Beethoven revolutionize music while preserving tonality?",
      "options": [
        "He invented new instruments and changed orchestration",
        "He expanded scale (longer symphonies), emotional range (struggle, triumph, tragedy), development techniques, and structural freedom—but kept harmonic grammar and key-based tonality",
        "He simplified music to make it more accessible",
        "He combined opera and symphony into new hybrid forms"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Beethoven revolutionized music without destroying tonality. He expanded: scale (symphonies got longer, more complex), emotional range (music could express struggle, triumph, transcendence), development (building movements from tiny motifs), structural freedom (adding movements, breaking rules). But he preserved harmonic grammar—even the violent Grosse Fuge is in B-flat major. It has a key, it resolves. Schoenberg later said: 'Beethoven showed us how to develop ideas, but he didn't break the harmonic system. That was my job.'"

      "options": [
        "National pride: Brahms was Austrian, Wagner was German",

        "Religious differences: Protestant vs. Catholic music",
        "Competition for opera commissions"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Brahms-Wagner split represented fundamental disagreement about music's purpose. Brahms defended absolute music—music as abstract structure that doesn't need stories or programs, should stand on formal logic alone. Wagner championed program music—music should tell stories, depict emotions, integrate with theater (Gesamtkunstwerk). Critic Eduard Hanslick championed Brahms, while Wagnerians saw him as conservative. This wasn't just aesthetic—it was political: Brahms = conservative Classical values, Wagner = Romantic revolutionary change. Vienna became a battleground."

    {
      "question": "Why did Mahler's symphonies push tonality to the breaking point?",
      "options": [
        "He deliberately tried to destroy music tradition",
        "He used extreme chromaticism, unresolved dissonances, collage techniques—testing how much ambiguity tonality could handle while obsessively exploring death in a dying empire",
        "He lacked proper musical training",
        "He was imitating French Impressionist composers"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mahler's symphonies are tonal—but barely. He used extreme chromaticism (notes outside the key creating ambiguity), unresolved dissonances (tension without release), collage technique (quoting folk tunes, marches, then distorting them). You can feel the tonal system straining under pressure. His death obsession came from personal tragedy (daughter's death, heart disease diagnosis in 1907), fin-de-siècle culture (living in dying Habsburg empire), Jewish outsider status. Schoenberg said: 'After Mahler, I had no choice but to abandon tonality. He pushed it as far as it could go.'"

    {
      "question": "What did Schoenberg's atonal revolution (1908-1912) accomplish and why was it controversial?",
      "options": [
        "It made music more popular and accessible to mass audiences",
        "It destroyed 300 years of Western music grammar—no keys, no harmonic home, just dissonance—paralleling Freud's unconscious and Klimt's chaos, but audiences hated it",
        "It proved mathematics could create perfect beauty",
        "It returned to Medieval church modes"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schoenberg abandoned tonality 1908-1912 (Erwartung, Pierrot Lunaire). Listening to atonal music feels like falling—no tonal 'home,' no resolution, endless dissonance. His explanation: 'Tonality was exhausted' after Wagner's Tristan chord and Mahler's chromaticism. He later compared it to Freud: 'Freud revealed the unconscious beneath rational mind. I revealed the atonal beneath tonal—music's unconscious.' At 1913 Vienna concert, audience rioted. Critics: 'This isn't music, it's organized noise.' Schoenberg: 'In 50 years, audiences will understand.' Partially right—studied in conservatories but never popular."
