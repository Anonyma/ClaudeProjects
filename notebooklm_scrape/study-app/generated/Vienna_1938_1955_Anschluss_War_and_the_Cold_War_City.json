  "article": "# Vienna 1938-1955: Anschluss, War, and the Cold War City\n\n## Introduction: The City That Welcomed Its Destroyer\n\nOn **March 12, 1938**, Adolf Hitler—born in Austria, rejected by Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts (1907)—returned to the city as **conqueror**.\n\nHe stood on the balcony of the Hofburg Palace (former Habsburg imperial residence) and declared Austria's **annexation** into Nazi Germany: **Anschluss** (\"union\").\n\nBelow him: **200,000+ Viennese** packed into Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square), cheering, saluting, weeping with joy.\n\nThis wasn't coerced. This wasn't fear. This was **genuine enthusiasm**.\n\nVienna—cosmopolitan imperial capital, home to Freud, Klimt, Mahler, Schoenberg—**welcomed the Nazis**.\n\nWithin **weeks**:\n- Jews were beaten in the streets\n- Jewish property was confiscated\n- Synagogues were vandalized\n- Jewish intellectuals fled or were arrested\n- Vienna's extraordinary cultural life was **destroyed**\n\nWithin **years**:\n- **65,000+ Viennese Jews** were murdered in concentration camps (Auschwitz, Theresienstadt, Treblinka)\n- Vienna was bombed by Allied forces\n- The city was **occupied** by four powers (US, Soviet, British, French)\n- It became a **Cold War spy capital**—the \"Third Man\" city of ruins, black markets, and intrigue\n\nBy **1955**, Austria regained independence—but only by embracing a **lie**: the \"first victim\" myth (Austria was Hitler's victim, not his accomplice).\n\nThis is the story of Vienna's **darkest chapter**—and how it tried to forget.\n\n---\n\n## March 1938: The Anschluss\n\n### The Road to Annexation\n\nAustria after WWI (1918) was a **rump state**:\n- Lost empire (Habsburg collapse)\n- **6.5 million people** (down from 54 million in Austro-Hungarian Empire)\n- Vienna = **2 million** (nearly 1/3 of Austria's population)—an imperial capital without an empire\n- Economic crisis, unemployment, political polarization\n\nTwo main political forces:\n\n**Social Democrats** (\"Red Vienna\" 1919-1934): Built 60,000 apartments, worker education, health programs.\n\n**Christian Socials / Austrofascists** (conservative, Catholic): Controlled national government, opposed Red Vienna.\n\nIn **February 1934**, Chancellor **Engelbert Dollfuss** (Austrofascist) crushed Red Vienna in a brief civil war (shelling Karl-Marx-Hof). Social Democratic Party was banned.\n\nIn **July 1934**, Austrian **Nazis** attempted a coup, murdering Dollfuss. The coup failed, but it showed Nazi strength in Austria.\n\n**1934-1938: Austrofascism** under Chancellors **Kurt Schuschnigg**:\n- Authoritarian regime (Catholic, corporatist, anti-Nazi **but also anti-democratic**)\n- Tried to preserve Austrian independence against Nazi Germany\n- But faced pressure from Hitler and internal Nazi sympathizers\n\n### March 1938: Hitler's Ultimatum\n\nIn early **March 1938**, Hitler demanded Schuschnigg appoint Nazis to government and allow a referendum on Anschluss.\n\nSchuschnigg tried to outmaneuver Hitler: called a **snap referendum** (March 13) asking Austrians to vote for **independence**.\n\nHitler responded with an **ultimatum** (March 11): Cancel the referendum, resign, or Germany will invade.\n\nSchuschnigg **resigned**. Hitler appointed Austrian Nazi **Arthur Seyss-Inquart** as chancellor.\n\nOn **March 12, 1938**, German troops **crossed the border**. No resistance.\n\nHitler entered Austria, traveling to his hometown (Linz), then to **Vienna**.\n\n### March 15: The Heldenplatz Speech\n\nOn **March 15, 1938**, Hitler spoke from the Hofburg balcony to a **massive crowd** in Heldenplatz.\n\nHe declared:\n\n> *\"As Führer and Chancellor of the German nation and Reich, I announce before history the entry of my homeland into the German Reich!\"*\n\nThe crowd **roared** approval.\n\nPhotos and films show:\n- **Nazi salutes**\n- **Swastika flags** everywhere\n- **Joyful faces**—people weeping with happiness, celebrating\n\nThis was **not** a city under occupation resisting in sullen silence.\n\nThis was a city **celebrating**.\n\n### Who Supported the Anschluss?\n\nNot everyone was enthusiastic. But **many were**:\n\n**1. Pan-German nationalists**: Many Austrians had **always wanted** union with Germany. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles **prohibited** Anschluss, but the desire persisted.\n\n**2. Austrian Nazis**: A significant Nazi movement existed in Austria **before** 1938 (they'd attempted the 1934 coup).\n\n**3. Working-class and petty bourgeoisie**: Economic crisis, unemployment, resentment of elites—Hitler promised jobs, prosperity, national pride.\n\n**4. Antisemites**: Vienna had a long history of antisemitism (Mayor Karl Lueger's 1897-1910 antisemitic campaigns). Many Austrians blamed Jews for economic problems.\n\n**Who opposed?**\n\n**1. Social Democrats and communists** (already banned/underground)\n\n**2. Some Catholics** (Church was ambivalent—officially opposed Nazis, but many Catholics supported them)\n\n**3. Jews** (obviously)\n\n**4. Habsburg loyalists** (who wanted restoration of monarchy, not union with Germany)\n\nBut opposition was **weak, fragmented, silenced**.\n\n---\n\n## The Destruction of Vienna's Jewish Community\n\n### Demographics: Vienna's Jews\n\nBefore Anschluss, Vienna had roughly **185,000-200,000 Jews** (about 10% of population).\n\nThey were:\n- **Disproportionately prominent** in culture, professions, business\n- Freud, Schoenberg, Schnitzler, Mahler (converted but considered Jewish), Stefan Zweig, Karl Kraus, many Vienna Circle philosophers, etc.\n- Many were secular, assimilated, German-speaking—considered themselves **Austrian first, Jewish second**\n\nThey thought: **We're Viennese. We belong here.**\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n### March-November 1938: Terror and Humiliation\n\n**Immediate violence** (March 1938):\n\nWithin **hours** of Anschluss, Viennese Nazis and ordinary citizens began attacking Jews:\n\n**\"Scrubbing parties\"**: Jews were forced to **scrub streets** with toothbrushes while crowds mocked them. Elderly Jews, respectable professionals, made to kneel and scrub pavements.\n\n**Property confiscation**: Jewish businesses were **\"Aryanized\"**—taken over by non-Jews. Jewish apartments were confiscated.\n\n**Beatings and arrests**: SA (Nazi paramilitary) and ordinary Austrians beat Jews in the streets. Thousands arrested.\n\nEichmann (Adolf Eichmann, later architect of Holocaust logistics) was **sent to Vienna** to organize Jewish emigration and deportation. He established the **Central Office for Jewish Emigration** (August 1938).\n\n**Kristallnacht** (November 9-10, 1938):\n\nNazi pogrom across Germany and Austria:\n- **Synagogues burned** (Vienna's main synagogues destroyed or vandalized)\n- **Jewish shops smashed** (\"Night of Broken Glass\")\n- **~30,000 Jews arrested** across Germany/Austria, sent to concentration camps (Dachau, Buchenwald)\n\nIn Vienna: 42 synagogues and prayer houses destroyed, 4,000+ Jewish shops looted.\n\n### The Flight: Who Escaped?\n\n**~130,000 Austrian Jews** managed to **emigrate** 1938-1941 (before emigration became impossible).\n\nNotable escapes:\n\n**Sigmund Freud** (age 82): Initially wanted to stay, but daughter Anna convinced him. International pressure (British, American) secured exit visa. Fled to **London** (June 1938). Died 1939.\n\nFour of Freud's sisters **stayed**. All four were **murdered** in concentration camps.\n\n**Arnold Schoenberg**: Fled to **US** (1933, before Anschluss, but anticipating danger). Became professor at UCLA. Died Los Angeles 1951.\n\n**Stefan Zweig**: Fled to **UK**, then **Brazil**. Committed suicide (with his wife) **February 1942** in despair over Europe's destruction.\n\n**Bruno Bettelheim** (psychologist): Arrested after Anschluss, sent to Dachau and Buchenwald (1938-1939). Released (unclear why), fled to **US**, became influential child psychologist.\n\n**Many couldn't escape**: Emigration required **visas** (most countries had strict quotas limiting Jewish refugees), **money** (to pay exit fees, travel, resettle), **connections** (to secure visas and sponsorship).\n\nPoor Jews, elderly Jews, Jews without international connections—**trapped**.\n\n### 1939-1945: The Holocaust\n\nStarting **1939**, systematic deportations:\n\n- **1939-1941**: Some emigration still possible (though increasingly difficult)\n- **October 1941**: Emigration **banned**. Jews trapped.\n- **1941-1945**: Mass deportations to **ghettos** (Łódź, Warsaw) and **extermination camps** (Auschwitz, Treblinka, Sobibor)\n\n**Theresienstadt** (Terezín, in Czech lands): \"Model ghetto\" where some Viennese Jews were sent—used for Nazi propaganda (\"See, we're treating them well\"), but many died of disease/starvation, and survivors were later sent to Auschwitz.\n\n**Total murdered**: Of Vienna's ~185,000-200,000 Jews:\n- ~130,000 emigrated (survived)\n- **~65,000 murdered** in Holocaust\n\n### The Cultural Destruction\n\nThe Holocaust didn't just kill people. It **destroyed** Vienna's cultural ecosystem:\n\n**Psychoanalysis**: Freud fled/died. His colleagues fled (Anna Freud to UK, others to US). Vienna's psychoanalytic institutes shut down.\n\n**Music**: Schoenberg fled. Alban Berg died 1935 (before Anschluss). Anton Webern accidentally shot by US soldier 1945. The Second Viennese School was **scattered**.\n\n**Literature**: Schnitzler died 1931 (before Anschluss). Zweig fled, committed suicide 1942. Karl Kraus died 1936.\n\n**Vienna Circle** (logical positivists): Moritz Schlick murdered 1936 (by deranged student, not Nazis—but context of rising fascism). Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, others fled to US/UK.\n\nThe **coffeehouse culture**—where intellectuals met, argued, created—was **destroyed**. The coffeehouses still existed physically, but the people were **gone**.\n\nVienna's **golden age** (1890s-1914) had already ended with WWI. But there was still cultural continuity through the 1920s-30s.\n\nAnschluss and Holocaust **finished** it. The people who embodied that culture were dead or exiled.\n\nPost-war Vienna was culturally **impoverished** compared to its fin-de-siècle peak.\n\n---\n\n## 1939-1945: Vienna in World War II\n\n### Vienna Under Nazi Rule\n\nAfter Anschluss, Vienna was absorbed into Nazi Germany:\n\n**Renamed**: **\"Ostmark\"** (Eastern March)—Austria's name was erased.\n\n**Vienna** became **provincial capital** of Ostmark—no longer even an **independent city-state** like it had been 1919-1938.\n\n**War economy**: Factories converted to war production (weapons, ammunition, vehicles). Forced labor (POWs, concentration camp prisoners) used in Vienna's factories.\n\n**Air raid shelters**: Vienna's palaces, basements, tunnels converted to shelters (expecting Allied bombing).\n\n### Allied Bombing (1943-1945)\n\nStarting **1943**, Allied forces bombed Vienna:\n\n**US Army Air Forces**: Bombed industrial targets, rail yards, oil refineries (Vienna had major refineries).\n\n**Royal Air Force**: Also bombed Vienna, though less heavily than Berlin or Dresden.\n\n**Major raids**:\n- **March 1944**: Heavy bombing of industrial areas\n- **1944-1945**: ~50+ raids total\n\n**Damage**:\n- **~20% of city destroyed** (compared to ~50%+ in Berlin)\n- **Vienna State Opera**: Destroyed March 1945 (direct hit)\n- **Burgtheater**: Damaged\n- **St. Stephen's Cathedral**: Damaged (roof burned)\n- **Residential areas**: Thousands of buildings damaged or destroyed\n- **~9,000 civilians killed** in air raids\n\nVienna was bombed, but **less devastated** than Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg. Much of the historic center survived.\n\n### April 1945: Soviet Capture\n\nAs Soviet forces advanced into Austria (March-April 1945):\n\n**Battle of Vienna** (April 2-13, 1945): Soviet Red Army vs. German Wehrmacht and SS.\n\nFighting in streets, house-to-house combat. Germans defended bridges over Danube.\n\n**April 13, 1945**: Soviets **captured Vienna**.\n\nGerman forces retreated west. Vienna was now **Soviet-occupied**.\n\n**May 8, 1945**: Germany surrendered. War in Europe ended.\n\nVienna was **liberated**—but also **occupied**.\n\n---\n\n## 1945-1955: The Four-Power Occupation\n\n### Division of the City\n\nAt Yalta and Potsdam conferences (1945), the Allies agreed:\n\n**Austria** would be occupied by **four powers**: US, Soviet Union, UK, France.\n\n**Vienna** would be divided into **four zones**:\n- **Soviet zone**: Districts 2, 4, 10, 20, 21, 22 (eastern/northern Vienna)\n- **US zone**: Districts 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19 (western Vienna)\n- **British zone**: Districts 3, 5, 11, 12, 13 (southern Vienna)\n- **French zone**: Districts 6, 14, 15, 16 (southwestern Vienna)\n\n**Inner City** (District 1): **Jointly administered**—rotated monthly between the four powers. Patrolled by **four-power patrols** (jeeps with soldiers from all four nations).\n\nThis created a **unique situation**: Unlike Berlin (surrounded by Soviet zone, divided into sectors), Vienna was **within** the Soviet zone of Austria—but the Inner City was joint.\n\n### The \"Third Man\" City\n\nThe **1949 film \"The Third Man\"** (directed by Carol Reed, screenplay by Graham Greene, starring Orson Welles) captured occupation-era Vienna:\n\n**Plot**: Black market intrigue, murder, espionage in ruined, divided Vienna.\n\n**Iconic imagery**:\n- **Rubble-strewn streets**\n- **Zither music** (Anton Karas's haunting theme)\n- **Vienna's sewers** (climactic chase scene)\n- **Prater Ferris wheel** (Welles's famous speech)\n\n**Famous dialogue** (Harry Lime / Orson Welles):\n\n> *\"In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love—they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\"*\n\nThe film **mythologized** Vienna as:\n- **Noir city**: Dark, dangerous, morally ambiguous\n- **Spy capital**: East-West intrigue\n- **Ruins**: Physical and moral\n\nThis became Vienna's **post-war image**—replacing its earlier image as cultural/musical capital.\n\n### The Black Market Economy\n\nPost-war Vienna ran on **black market**:\n\n**Official economy**:\n- Rationing (food, coal, clothing)\n- Worthless currency (Austrian schilling had little value)\n- Unemployment, poverty\n\n**Black market**:\n- **Coffee, cigarettes, chocolate**: Currency of exchange (more valuable than money)\n- **Art treasures**: Looted during war, sold/traded for food\n- **Penicillin**: Scarce medical supplies smuggled and sold\n- **Stolen goods**: From bombed buildings, warehouses\n\n**Soviet plunder**: Soviet forces **systematically looted** Vienna—took factory equipment (dismantled and shipped to USSR), art, valuables. Called it \"reparations.\"\n\n**Allied soldiers**: US, British, French soldiers had access to goods unavailable to Austrians (cigarettes, coffee, canned food). They traded on black market.\n\n**Survival**: For ordinary Viennese, black market was **necessary** for survival. Official rations weren't enough.\n\nThis created a **culture of corruption, improvisation, hustling**—very different from Vienna's earlier bourgeois propriety.\n\n### Cold War Spy Capital\n\nVienna's divided status made it a **Cold War hotspot**:\n\n**Espionage**: Soviet vs. Western intelligence services operated openly.\n\n**Defections**: East Bloc officials defected in Vienna (easier to reach Western zones than in Berlin).\n\n**Intrigue**: Kidnappings, assassinations, surveillance.\n\nNotable incidents:\n\n**1948**: **Jan Masaryk** (Czech foreign minister) died under mysterious circumstances in Prague—Western intelligence suspected Soviet murder.\n\n**1953**: **US Embassy** in Vienna was a hub for CIA operations in Eastern Europe.\n\n**Soviet presence**: KGB operated freely in Soviet zone and infiltrated other zones.\n\nVienna wasn't as **central** to Cold War as Berlin—but it was still a significant intelligence battleground.\n\n---\n\n## 1955: The State Treaty and Neutrality\n\n### Negotiations\n\nFrom **1945-1955**, Austria was **occupied**. But unlike Germany (divided into East/West), Austria was treated as a **single entity**.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. **Moscow Declaration (1943)**: Allies declared Austria was **\"first victim\"** of Nazi aggression (more on this later). This implied Austria deserved independence, not permanent division.\n\n2. **Strategic calculation**: Soviets saw advantage in **neutral Austria** (buffer zone between West and East) rather than divided Austria (which might push Western Austria into NATO).\n\n### The 1955 State Treaty\n\nOn **May 15, 1955**, the **Austrian State Treaty** was signed in Vienna's Belvedere Palace.\n\nTerms:\n\n**1. Independence**: Austria regained full sovereignty.\n\n**2. Permanent neutrality**: Austria would be **neutral**—not join NATO or Warsaw Pact, not host foreign military bases.\n\n**3. No Anschluss**: Austria could **never** unite with Germany again.\n\n**4. Allied withdrawal**: All occupation forces would leave within 90 days.\n\n**5. Reparations**: Austria would pay (limited) reparations to USSR.\n\n**6. Democratic government**: Austria committed to democracy, human rights.\n\nBy **October 1955**, all occupation forces had **withdrawn**.\n\nAustria was **free**—the **only** former Nazi-aligned territory to regain independence during the Cold War (Germany stayed divided until 1990).\n\n### Why Did Soviets Agree?\n\n**1. Buffer zone**: Neutral Austria = buffer between NATO (West Germany, Italy) and Warsaw Pact (Hungary, Czechoslovakia).\n\n**2. Propaganda victory**: Soviets could claim they **liberated** Austria (unlike US \"occupation\" of West Germany).\n\n**3. Economic benefit**: Austria paid reparations, traded with USSR.\n\n**4. German question**: Soviets hoped neutral Austria would set **precedent** for **reunified neutral Germany**. (This didn't happen—West Germany joined NATO 1955, division lasted until 1990.)\n\n### Permanent Neutrality\n\nAustria's **neutrality** (modeled on Switzerland) became **core** of post-war identity:\n\n- **No military alliances**: Stayed out of NATO and Warsaw Pact\n- **UN membership** (1955): Active in international organizations\n- **Diplomatic hub**: Vienna became home to **UN agencies** (IAEA, UNIDO, etc.)\n- **Cold War bridge**: Neutral ground for East-West summits (Kennedy-Khrushchev met in Vienna, 1961)\n\nThis worked through the Cold War—Austria was **safe**, prosperous, neutral.\n\nBut post-Cold War: Austria joined **EU** (1995), raising questions about neutrality. Still **hasn't** joined NATO (as of 2026).\n\n---\n\n## The \"First Victim\" Myth: Collective Amnesia\n\n### The Claim\n\nThe **1943 Moscow Declaration** (Allies' statement during WWII) said:\n\n> *\"Austria, the first free country to fall victim to Hitlerite aggression, shall be liberated from German domination.\"*\n\nThis was **wartime propaganda**—meant to encourage Austrian resistance to Nazis.\n\nBut post-war, Austria **embraced** this narrative:\n\n**\"Austria was Hitler's first victim. We were occupied, not accomplices.\"**\n\nThis became **official Austrian identity** through the 1950s-1980s.\n\n### The Reality\n\nThis was a **lie**—or at least, a severe **distortion**:\n\n**1. Enthusiastic support**: As discussed, the Anschluss was **welcomed** by massive crowds. Many Austrians supported Nazis.\n\n**2. Austrian Nazis**: ~700,000 Austrians joined the Nazi Party (out of ~6.5 million total population = ~10%).\n\n**3. Participation in Holocaust**: Austrians were **disproportionately represented** in SS and concentration camp staff. Adolf Eichmann, Amon Göth (Płaszów commandant), Franz Stangl (Sobibor/Treblinka commandant)—all Austrian.\n\n**4. War crimes**: Austrians participated in Wehrmacht, SS, war crimes on Eastern Front.\n\n**~600,000 Austrians** served in German military during WWII. Many participated in atrocities.\n\n### Why the Myth?\n\n**1. Psychological need**: Austrians needed to **rebuild identity** after catastrophic defeat. Easier to be \"victims\" than confront complicity.\n\n**2. Political convenience**: Cold War Allies wanted **stable, neutral Austria**. Prosecuting Austrian war criminals and confronting complicity would be **destabilizing**.\n\n**3. Avoiding reparations**: If Austria was a **victim**, it didn't owe reparations to Holocaust survivors or conquered nations. If it was **complicit**, it would.\n\n**4. National unity**: Both left and right in Austria could agree on \"first victim\" narrative. Questioning it would reopen political wounds.\n\n### Consequences\n\n**1. No justice**: Very few Austrian war criminals prosecuted. Many lived openly in Austria post-war.\n\n**2. No reparations**: Austria paid **no reparations** to Holocaust survivors or forced laborers (unlike Germany, which paid billions).\n\n**3. Antisemitic continuity**: Antisemitism persisted in Austria through 1950s-1980s. Jewish survivors who returned faced hostility.\n\n**4. Delayed reckoning**: Only in **1980s-1990s** did Austria begin seriously confronting its Nazi past (triggered by **Kurt Waldheim affair**, 1986—Austrian president revealed to have hidden Nazi past).\n\n**5. Impoverished memory culture**: Unlike Germany (which built extensive Holocaust memorials, education programs), Austria's memory culture was **weak** until recently.\n\n### The Waldheim Affair (1986)\n\n**Kurt Waldheim**: Austrian diplomat, UN Secretary-General (1972-1981), ran for Austrian president (1986).\n\nDuring campaign, **journalists revealed**: Waldheim had **lied** about his WWII service. He claimed he was wounded and discharged 1941. Actually, he served in Wehrmacht in Balkans 1942-1945, in units involved in **war crimes** (deportations, massacres).\n\nWaldheim **denied** knowing about atrocities. International outrage. US put him on **watch list** (banned from entering US).\n\nBut in Austria: **He won the presidency** (1986). Many Austrians **defended** him, saw criticism as unfair attack on Austria.\n\nThis exposed the **persistence** of \"first victim\" myth and unwillingness to confront Nazi past.\n\nOnly **after** Waldheim scandal did Austria begin serious reckoning—establishing Holocaust education, restitution programs (though still inadequate), memorials.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The City That Forgot\n\nVienna 1938-1955 was a period of **catastrophe and erasure**:\n\n**1938**: The city **welcomed** its own destruction—Anschluss with Nazi Germany.\n\n**1938-1945**: Vienna's Jewish cultural elite was **murdered or exiled**. The city that produced Freud, Mahler, Klimt, Schoenberg was **culturally gutted**.\n\n**1945-1955**: The city was **occupied, divided, impoverished**—a Cold War spy capital of black markets and ruins.\n\n**1955-onward**: The city **rebuilt**—but on a foundation of **collective amnesia**. The \"first victim\" myth allowed Austria to avoid confronting its complicity.\n\nToday, Vienna is:\n- **Beautiful**: The Ringstraße, palaces, Opera (rebuilt), museums, coffeehouses—physically restored.\n- **Prosperous**: Wealthy, stable, high quality of life.\n- **Culturally rich**: Major museums, music (Vienna Philharmonic, Opera), international city.\n\nBut something is **missing**.\n\nThe **cultural ecosystem** that produced fin-de-siècle Vienna—that combination of Jewish intellectuals, coffeehouse culture, imperial patronage, creative tension—was **destroyed** in 1938-1945.\n\nYou can visit Freud's apartment (now a museum). You can attend Opera performances. You can sit in the coffeehouses.\n\nBut the **people** are gone. And they're not coming back.\n\nVienna rebuilt its **buildings**. It took much longer to rebuild its **memory**.\n\nAnd the full reckoning—with Austrian enthusiasm for Nazism, with the Holocaust, with decades of denial—is still, arguably, **incomplete**.\n\nThe city that **invented** psychoanalysis—the method for **making the unconscious conscious**—spent decades **repressing** its own past.\n\nThe irony is profound. And painful.",

March 15: Hitler spoke from Hofburg balcony to 200,000+ crowd in Heldenplatz—roaring approval, Nazi salutes, swastikas everywhere, joyful faces weeping with happiness. This was NOT occupation resisting in silence—this was CELEBRATION. Support came from: (1) Pan-German nationalists (always wanted union with Germany); (2) Austrian Nazis (significant movement before 1938, attempted 1934 coup); (3) Working-class/petty bourgeoisie (economic crisis, unemployment, Hitler promised jobs/prosperity); (4) Antisemites (Vienna's long antisemitic tradition, many blamed Jews for economic problems)."

DEPORTATIONS: Oct 1941 emigration banned; 1941-1945 mass deportations to ghettos (Łódź, Warsaw) and camps (Auschwitz, Treblinka, Theresienstadt). TOTAL: ~65,000 Viennese Jews murdered.

INNER CITY (District 1): JOINTLY administered, rotated monthly between four powers, patrolled by four-power patrols (jeeps with soldiers from all nations). Unique vs. Berlin: Vienna was WITHIN Soviet zone of Austria but Inner City was joint. 'THIRD MAN' CITY: 1949 film captured occupation-era Vienna—rubble, sewers, Ferris wheel, zither music.

WHY SOVIETS AGREED: (1) BUFFER ZONE—neutral Austria between NATO (West Germany, Italy) and Warsaw Pact (Hungary, Czechoslovakia); (2) PROPAGANDA—Soviets 'liberated' Austria (vs. US 'occupation' of West Germany); (3) ECONOMIC—reparations, trade; (4) GERMAN PRECEDENT—hoped neutral Austria would set example for reunified neutral Germany (didn't happen—West Germany joined NATO 1955, division lasted to 1990).

WHY THE MYTH: Psychological need (rebuild identity), political convenience (Cold War wanted stable Austria), avoiding reparations, national unity. CONSEQUENCES: No prosecutions, no reparations (unlike Germany), antisemitism persisted, delayed reckoning. 1986 WALDHEIM AFFAIR: Revealed president lied about WWII service (war crimes units)—but he WON presidency.
