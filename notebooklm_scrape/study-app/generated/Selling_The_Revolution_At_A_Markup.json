  "article": "## The Myth of Spontaneous Revolution\n\nThe image arrives unbidden whenever the 1960s are invoked: a kaleidoscope of tie-dye shirts, peace signs flashed at cameras, muddy fields filled with swaying bodies, and cascades of long hair framing faces lifted toward some invisible promise. This visual shorthand has become so deeply embedded in cultural memory that it functions less as history and more as mythology. The hippie appears as a kind of spontaneous generation, emerging fully formed from the American soil like some indigenous flower of consciousness.\n\nBut mythology, by definition, obscures as much as it reveals. The historical record tells a considerably more complex story, one in which the counterculture was not merely a cultural phenomenon but an economic one, shaped by demographic forces and ultimately transformed by the very market mechanisms it claimed to reject. The hippie was not simply a person who appeared at a particular moment in time. The hippie became, with remarkable speed, a product.\n\nUnderstanding how rebellion became a brand requires excavating the structural conditions that made the 1960s possible, the internal divisions that fractured the movement from within, and the sophisticated mechanisms by which capitalism absorbed its most vocal critics. What emerges is not a simple story of co-optation but a more troubling recognition: the aesthetics of liberation may be more easily commodified than liberation itself.\n\n## The Demographics of Discontent\n\nThe counterculture did not emerge from a vacuum. It was the predictable product of an unprecedented demographic event: the post-war baby boom, which created the largest cohort of young people in American history. Between 1946 and 1964, approximately 76 million children were born in the United States, fundamentally reshaping the nation's age distribution and, by extension, its cultural center of gravity.\n\nBut numbers alone do not explain the particular character of 1960s rebellion. The crucial variable was not the size of this generation but its relationship to material security. The parents of the baby boomers had been forged in the crucible of the Great Depression and World War II. They had known genuine scarcity, had seen economic systems collapse, had witnessed the world consume itself in industrial-scale violence. Their response to trauma was entirely rational: an obsessive pursuit of material security. The house in the suburbs, the steady job with the reliable company, the full refrigerator, the new car in the driveway, these were not mere consumer preferences but psychological defenses against chaos.\n\nTheir children inherited the security without inheriting the trauma. Born into the post-war economic expansion, the baby boomers came of age in unprecedented affluence. They had never known the soup lines or the ration books. Their safety net was invisible precisely because it had always been there. And this security granted them a luxury their parents could never have imagined: the luxury of asking whether material comfort was enough.\n\nThis is the paradox that conventional narratives of the 1960s fail to grasp. The counterculture was not a rejection of capitalism from outside the system but a critique mounted from within conditions of relative privilege. When survival is not in question, energy becomes available for questions of meaning. When the refrigerator is always full, one can afford to wonder whether a full refrigerator constitutes a life worth living.\n\n## The Great Refusal\n\nThe philosopher Herbert Marcuse gave this phenomenon a name: the Great Refusal. In his influential 1964 work \"One-Dimensional Man,\" Marcuse argued that advanced industrial society had created a new form of totalitarianism, not through overt repression but through the satisfaction of false needs. Consumer capitalism had become so effective at delivering material comfort that it had neutralized the capacity for critical thought. People were not oppressed; they were pacified.\n\nBut Marcuse also identified a possibility: that those who had grown up within affluence might be uniquely positioned to recognize its emptiness. Having never been seduced by the promise of material security (since they had always possessed it), they might be capable of seeing through the ideological apparatus that equated consumption with fulfillment.\n\nThe Great Refusal was precisely this: a comprehensive rejection of the American Dream as defined by the previous generation. The suburbs, the corporate career ladder, the nuclear family as consuming unit, the whole package was deemed spiritually bankrupt. The counterculture did not want better terms within the existing system; it wanted to opt out of the system entirely.\n\nYet this refusal was always shadowed by its own conditions of possibility. One could only refuse a system that had already provided for one's basic needs. The dropout could only drop out because there was something to drop out from. This structural irony would prove fatal to the movement's more radical aspirations.\n\n## The Architecture of Distrust\n\nAffluence alone does not produce rebellion. The postwar generation also came of age under the shadow of unprecedented existential threat. The Cold War was not merely a geopolitical arrangement but a psychological condition, a permanent state of emergency that fundamentally altered the relationship between citizens and their government.\n\nChildren of the 1950s grew up performing duck-and-cover drills in their classrooms, crawling beneath their desks in ritualized preparation for nuclear annihilation. The absurdity of the exercise, the notion that a wooden desk could provide meaningful protection against atomic weapons, was not lost on them. The state was simultaneously claiming to protect them while preparing them for a catastrophe it seemed powerless to prevent.\n\nFor young men, the draft hung as a constant presence, transforming the abstract threat of the Cold War into intimate personal risk. The state claimed the right to conscript citizens' bodies for military adventures whose rationale grew increasingly opaque. Vietnam, in particular, became the crucible in which government credibility was forged and then shattered.\n\nThe erosion of institutional trust proceeded through a series of specific events that assumed the character of revelation. The U-2 incident of 1960 was paradigmatic. When an American reconnaissance aircraft was shot down over Soviet territory, President Eisenhower initially claimed it was a weather research plane that had strayed off course. The Soviets then produced the pilot, Francis Gary Powers, along with the wreckage of what was unmistakably a spy plane equipped with sophisticated surveillance equipment.\n\nThe lie was not merely embarrassing; it was clarifying. If the government would lie about this, what else would it lie about? The Bay of Pigs invasion, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the systematic deceptions revealed by the Pentagon Papers, each served to confirm a emerging conviction: the establishment was not merely mistaken but actively deceitful, and its deceptions carried potentially apocalyptic consequences.\n\nThe logic that followed was not unreasonable: if the people managing the nuclear arsenal were willing to lie to the public, if the same authorities prosecuting an incomprehensible war in Southeast Asia were demonstrably untrustworthy, why should their other claims to authority be respected? The counterculture's rejection of conventional morality, career paths, and lifestyle expectations was, in this light, a rational response to the perceived bankruptcy of the institutions that had traditionally underwritten such conventions.\n\n## A Movement of Movements\n\nThe term \"hippie\" suggests a coherent identity, a recognizable type that can be summarized and understood. This linguistic convenience obscures a more complicated reality. What is commonly remembered as \"the counterculture\" was in fact a loose confederation of distinct groups with overlapping but not identical commitments.\n\nAt the apex of commitment were the visionaries, the utopian social reformers who took the critique of capitalist society seriously enough to attempt building alternatives. The Diggers of San Francisco exemplified this tendency. Named after the seventeenth-century English agrarian radicals, the Diggers operated free stores where goods were distributed without charge, served free meals in Golden Gate Park, and organized free medical clinics. Their project was not merely charitable but ideological: a demonstration that exchange value was not the only possible basis for social organization.\n\nThe Diggers were doing the work. They were attempting to prove, through practical experiment, that life outside capitalist relations was possible. Their free stores were not acts of charity but provocations, challenges to the assumption that everything must be bought and sold. When a customer asked how much something cost, the standard Digger response was: \"It's free because it's yours.\"\n\nAdjacent to the visionaries were the freaks or heads, whose revolution was interior rather than social. Influenced by Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary, and the emerging literature of psychedelic experience, this faction sought transformation through altered states of consciousness. The premise was essentially Platonic: the everyday world was a cave of shadows, and the task was to perceive the light directly. If you changed your own mind, the argument went, you changed the world, because the world was, finally, a mental construct.\n\nThis emphasis on inner transformation had obvious limitations as a political program, but it was not without its own radicalism. The psychedelic experience tended to dissolve the categories through which consumer capitalism organized desire. The self that wanted the new car or the corner office was precisely what LSD called into question. In this sense, the heads were engaged in a kind of ontological sabotage, attacking the foundations of consumer subjectivity itself.\n\nThe midnight hippies represented a third tendency: the sympathizers who agreed with countercultural values but maintained conventional lives. They were teachers, nurses, lawyers, and accountants who listened to the music, attended the occasional protest, and perhaps smoked marijuana on weekends, but who could not or would not fully abandon their positions within straight society. They provided material support, legal assistance, and cultural validation without assuming the risks of total dropout.\n\nAnd then there was the largest group, the one that would prove decisive for the movement's ultimate trajectory: the plastic hippies. The term carries a sting of contempt, but its significance transcends mere insult. The plastic hippies were those who adopted the counterculture's aesthetic vocabulary, its fashion, its slang, its musical preferences, without necessarily embracing its political substance. They wore the bell-bottoms and the beads, grew their hair long, and spoke the language of liberation, but their engagement remained at the level of style rather than commitment.\n\n## The Conquest of Cool\n\nThe existence of the plastic hippies created an opportunity that advertisers were quick to recognize. If rebellion could be reduced to a set of visual signifiers, those signifiers could be detached from their original meanings and attached to products. The counterculture had developed a distinctive aesthetic precisely in order to mark its difference from mainstream society. That aesthetic could be appropriated, mass-produced, and sold back to young consumers as a badge of identity.\n\nThis process has been called \"the conquest of cool,\" and it represented not so much the defeat of the counterculture as its transformation into something altogether different. Advertising agencies began hiring young creatives who understood the new sensibility. Campaigns for soft drinks, cigarettes, automobiles, and clothing adopted countercultural imagery and rhetoric. Rebellion became a selling proposition.\n\nThe genius of this appropriation lay in its selectivity. What was marketed was never the political content of the counterculture, never the critique of imperialism or the analysis of alienation or the experiments in communal living. What was marketed was the look, the vibe, the feeling of being different. The counterculture was flattened into a lifestyle choice, and lifestyle choices, unlike political commitments, could be purchased.\n\nBy focusing on the plastic hippies, advertisers and media outlets effectively defined what the hippie was. The visionaries and their free stores, the political activists and their organizing, the commune-dwellers and their experiments in alternative economics, all of this was crowded out by the image of the stoned kid in the tie-dye shirt. If a hippie was merely someone who dressed a certain way and consumed certain products, then hippies posed no threat to the fundamental organization of society. They were simply another market segment.\n\nThis dynamic reveals something important about the relationship between capitalism and its critics. The system does not necessarily need to suppress dissent; it can absorb dissent, metabolize it, and excrete it in commodity form. The revolutionary impulse is not defeated but redirected, channeled away from structural change and toward consumer expression. You do not need to overthrow the system; you can buy the t-shirt that says you want to overthrow the system.\n\n## The Global Refusal\n\nThe American counterculture, despite its parochial self-regard, was part of a worldwide phenomenon. The same demographic and economic conditions that produced rebellion in San Francisco produced analogous movements across the developed world, though the specific character of each refusal was shaped by local conditions.\n\nIn Amsterdam, the Provos (short for \"provocateurs\") emerged between 1965 and 1967 as masters of what would today be called culture jamming. Their method was theatrical provocation, the staging of events designed to bait authorities into overreaction and thereby expose the repressive apparatus lurking beneath the liberal facade. A Provo happening might involve nothing more than standing silently in a public square, but if the police responded with force, the point was made.\n\nThe Provos were not merely pranksters. They developed a series of policy proposals called the White Plans, which were remarkably ahead of their time. The White Bicycle Plan proposed banning private automobiles from the city center and providing free white-painted bicycles for public use, an anarchist vision of shared transportation that would not be commercially realized until the bike-sharing programs of the twenty-first century. The White Women Plan advocated for comprehensive sex education and universal access to contraception. These were serious proposals dressed in absurdist clothing, and their influence on Amsterdam's subsequent development toward progressive urbanism was substantial.\n\nThe meaning of refusal was entirely different behind the Iron Curtain, where the stakes were not lifestyle but survival. In Czechoslovakia, the M-n-ky (a slur applied to young men with long hair) faced persecution not as a fashion statement but as a political crime. Long hair in a Western context might signify mild rebellion against parental expectations; in a communist state, it represented a visual rejection of state discipline, an assertion of bodily autonomy against a regime that claimed total authority over its citizens.\n\nThe crackdown was not subtle. Long-haired youth were banned from pubs, cinemas, and public transportation. Police conducted raids specifically targeting young men whose hair exceeded acceptable length. And in 1966, the Ministry of Interior compiled a detailed map tracking the geographic distribution of long-haired males across the entire country, a secret police heat map of hair.\n\nThis absurd detail illuminates a crucial point: counterculture is defined by what it opposes, and what it opposes reveals itself through its responses. The Czechoslovak state's paranoid surveillance of hairstyles demonstrated that even the most apparently superficial forms of nonconformity could carry genuine political weight in certain contexts. The plastic hippie in San Francisco and the Manicka in Prague were engaged in formally similar acts of aesthetic rebellion, but the price of refusal varied enormously depending on the system being refused.\n\n## The Techno-Utopian Inheritance\n\nThe most unexpected legacy of the counterculture is simultaneously the most visible: the digital technology that structures contemporary life. There is a direct, traceable line from the communes of New Mexico to the campuses of Silicon Valley, from the Whole Earth Catalog to the iPhone. The connection is not metaphorical but genealogical.\n\nThe communes themselves were populated largely by urban intellectuals who had dropped out of careers and universities. Their commitment to \"back to the land\" living was genuine but their practical skills were often minimal. They needed information: how to build a geodesic dome, how to install a composting toilet, how to grow vegetables, how to deliver a baby without a hospital. They needed, in the language of the time, access to tools.\n\nStewart Brand recognized this need and created the Whole Earth Catalog to address it. First published in 1968, the Catalog was not a store but a directory, a compendium of resources for self-sufficient living organized by category and annotated with reviews and commentary. Its famous slogan, \"We are as gods and might as well get good at it,\" captured the countercultural faith in individual empowerment through appropriate technology.\n\nSteve Jobs would later call the Whole Earth Catalog \"Google before Google,\" and the comparison is apt. The Catalog was, in effect, a search engine for the material world, a tool for navigating the overwhelming complexity of available knowledge and products. But more importantly, it embodied a philosophy that would prove foundational for the digital revolution: the belief that information should be freely shared and that tools should be accessible to individuals rather than concentrated in institutional hands.\n\nThe counterculture had developed an intense hostility toward what it saw as the mainframe mentality of corporate and governmental computing. The image of the massive, centralized computer, tended by white-coated technicians and serving the interests of IBM or the Pentagon, represented everything the movement rejected: hierarchy, expertise, concentrated power, the treatment of human beings as data points to be processed.\n\nThe personal computer was conceived as the antidote to this vision. The Homebrew Computer Club, founded in 1975 by a draft resister, brought together hobbyists and engineers who believed that computing power should be distributed rather than concentrated, that individuals should control their own information processing rather than submitting to institutional intermediaries. This was not merely a technical preference but an ideological commitment, a translation of countercultural values into electronic form.\n\nThe smartphone in your pocket is the distant descendant of these aspirations. It was designed, in its conceptual origins, as a tool for individual liberation, a device that would give ordinary people access to capabilities previously reserved for large organizations. Whether it has fulfilled that promise or become something else entirely is a question the counterculture did not live long enough to answer.\n\n## The Death of the Dream\n\nCultural eras do not end on calendar dates. They erode, sometimes gradually and sometimes through sudden shocks that crystallize a shift already underway. The counterculture's transition from hopeful experiment to cautionary tale can be traced through a series of events that accumulated into an irreversible transformation of mood.\n\nThe Manson Family murders of August 1969 were, in psychological terms, perhaps the most damaging. Charles Manson was not a product of the establishment. He looked like a hippie, spoke the language of consciousness and liberation, gathered followers on a commune, and used all the trappings of countercultural community to orchestrate brutal, senseless violence. The killings introduced a terrifying possibility: that the counterculture contained within itself the seeds of something sinister, that the rejection of conventional morality could lead not to higher consciousness but to savagery.\n\nBefore Manson, the hippie might be naive, unwashed, irritating to one's parents, but fundamentally peaceful. After Manson, the long hair and the commune could no longer be read as unambiguous signs of benevolence. The establishment had always warned that dropping out led to degeneracy; Manson seemed to confirm the warning.\n\nFour months later, the Altamont Free Concert provided the definitive anti-Woodstock. The Rolling Stones hired the Hells Angels motorcycle gang to provide security, paying them in beer. The decision would have been questionable under any circumstances; under the influence of alcohol and the volatile atmosphere of the crowd, it proved catastrophic. The concert descended into violence, culminating in the stabbing death of Meredith Hunter directly in front of the stage.\n\nAltamont demonstrated that good vibes were not, in fact, enough. The fantasy of spontaneous community, of people coming together in peace and love without the need for structures or rules, shattered against the reality of human aggression. If Woodstock was the dream, Altamont was the morning after, the hangover in which one surveys the wreckage and wonders what exactly had been celebrated.\n\nThe Kent State shootings of May 1970 marked a different kind of ending. When Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire on unarmed students protesting the Vietnam War, killing four and wounding nine, the stakes of dissent were suddenly lethal. The state had responded to the counterculture not with co-optation but with bullets. The fun revolution, the revolution of music and drugs and dropping out, was revealed to be operating in a context where the authorities retained the capacity for fatal violence.\n\n## The Economic Extinction\n\nBut it was ultimately neither violence nor tragedy that ended the 1960s as a lived social phenomenon. It was economics. The Great Refusal had been fueled by affluence, and when affluence contracted, the conditions for mass dropout contracted with it.\n\nThe oil crisis of 1973 sent shock waves through the global economy. The price of oil quadrupled virtually overnight, triggering inflation, recession, and unemployment. The easy money that had underwritten experiments in alternative living dried up. Suddenly, the question was not whether material security was spiritually sufficient but whether material security could be obtained at all.\n\nThe commune movement did not survive this transition. Over a million people had moved onto rural land during the height of the counterculture, but most of these experiments were economically marginal even in good times. When the broader economy contracted, they became untenable. The back-to-the-land movement discovered that land required capital, that tools cost money, that self-sufficiency was considerably more difficult than the Whole Earth Catalog had made it appear.\n\nThe midnight hippies cut their hair and went looking for jobs. The aesthetic preferences might persist, the music might remain in rotation, but the material basis for opting out of the system had evaporated. The era of mass experimentation literally ran out of gas.\n\n## The Persistence of Aesthetics\n\nThe counterculture failed to transform the fundamental structures of American society. The military-industrial complex was not dismantled. Capitalism was not replaced with communal ownership. The nuclear family remained the default social unit. The Vietnam War ended, but imperial adventures continued. By any measure of structural change, the movement achieved relatively little.\n\nAnd yet something persists. The environmental movement, from Greenpeace to Earth Day to contemporary climate activism, draws directly from countercultural reverence for nature and suspicion of industrial civilization. The LGBTQ rights movement traces important roots to the Stonewall uprising of 1969 and the gay liberation fronts that emerged from the broader ferment of the era. The democratization of technology, for all its ambiguities, reflects the countercultural dream of power distributed rather than concentrated.\n\nBut the most pervasive legacy may be the most troubling. Walk into any upscale grocery store and you will find organic produce, fair-trade coffee, sustainable seafood, products that signal consciousness and ethical consumption. Visit any yoga studio or wellness center and you will encounter practices and philosophies descended from the counterculture's interest in Eastern spirituality and alternative health. Look at any contemporary workplace and you will see casual dress codes, open floor plans, and corporate language about creativity and authenticity that would have been unthinkable in the gray flannel organization of the 1950s.\n\nThe aesthetics of the counterculture have triumphed completely. What was once a mark of rebellion is now a marketing demographic. The visual and linguistic vocabulary of liberation has been seamlessly integrated into consumer culture, stripped of political content and sold back to successive generations as lifestyle choices.\n\nWe buy pre-ripped jeans for hundreds of dollars, purchasing the signifiers of working-class authenticity from luxury brands. We practice mindfulness meditation in corporate wellness programs, employing techniques of consciousness developed to escape the rat race as tools for running it more efficiently. We celebrate disruptive innovation and think different while the structures of economic power grow ever more concentrated.\n\nThis is the ultimate irony of the 1960s: the counterculture's critique of consumer capitalism was so effective that consumer capitalism adopted the critique as its own aesthetic. The revolution was not suppressed; it was absorbed. The establishment did not defeat the rebels; it sold them their own rebellion at a markup.\n\n## The Question That Remains\n\nThe history of the counterculture poses a question that remains unanswered, perhaps unanswerable: Did the movement succeed by changing the culture, or did the culture succeed by neutralizing the movement? Is the presence of organic food and yoga studios and tech campuses designed like communes evidence that countercultural values have triumphed, or evidence that those values have been emptied of their transformative potential?\n\nThere is no comfortable resolution to this dilemma. The counterculture's demand for authenticity has become the dominant mode of consumer marketing. Its rejection of conformity has become the conformity of the creative class. Its vision of personal liberation has become the ideology of the gig economy, where workers are free to be their own brands in an ever more precarious labor market.\n\nPerhaps the lesson is that aesthetic rebellion is always vulnerable to commodification, that style divorced from structure can be captured and repurposed. Perhaps the lesson is that material conditions ultimately determine the possibilities for dissent, that dropping out is a luxury good available only when the economy provides the surplus to support it. Perhaps the lesson is that capitalism's greatest strength lies not in its ability to satisfy human needs but in its ability to absorb human desires, including the desire for an alternative to capitalism.\n\nOr perhaps the legacy of the 1960s is more hopeful than this analysis suggests. The movements for environmental protection, civil rights, gender equality, and personal freedom that emerged from that era have achieved genuine advances, whatever their limitations. The questioning of authority that began in the 1960s has not disappeared; if anything, it has intensified. The tools of communication and organization that the counterculture anticipated now exist at a scale that would have been unimaginable to Stewart Brand and the Homebrew Computer Club.\n\nThe question is not whether the revolution was sold at a markup but whether the sale was final. The conditions that produced the Great Refusal, affluence combined with existential threat, have not disappeared. The contradictions of consumer capitalism that the counterculture identified have, if anything, intensified. The possibility of refusal remains, even if its forms must be reinvented for a new era.\n\nDid we get the freedom, or did we just get the t-shirt? The answer may depend on what the next generation decides to do with the inheritance they have received: both the tools of liberation and the sophisticated mechanisms by which liberation is transformed into product.",

    {
      "question": "What material condition made the 'Great Refusal' of the 1960s counterculture possible?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Widespread poverty that made the American Dream seem unattainable",
        "B": "Post-war affluence that provided economic security to question material values",
        "C": "The Vietnam War draft that forced young people to flee the country",
        "D": "Television technology that exposed government propaganda"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The counterculture paradoxically emerged from privilege. Baby boomers born into post-war prosperity had never known scarcity, so they had the economic security and mental space to question whether material comfort was spiritually sufficient."
    },
    {
      "question": "What distinguished 'plastic hippies' from other counterculture factions?",
      "options": {
        "A": "They used plastic rather than organic materials in their crafts",
        "B": "They adopted the aesthetic style without the political substance",
        "C": "They were undercover government agents infiltrating the movement",
        "D": "They rejected all manufactured goods in favor of handmade items"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Plastic hippies adopted the counterculture's fashion, slang, and musical preferences while stripping out political content. This group enabled advertisers to reduce rebellion to purchasable signifiers, effectively neutralizing the movement's threat."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the Amsterdam Provos' 'White Bicycle Plan' relate to modern urban infrastructure?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It established the first commercial bike-sharing company",
        "B": "It anticipated bike-sharing programs by decades through free public bicycles",
        "C": "It created protected bike lanes throughout the city",
        "D": "It manufactured bicycles painted white for export to other countries"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Provos proposed banning cars from Amsterdam's center and providing free white-painted bicycles for public use in 1965-67. This anarchist vision of shared transportation would not be commercially realized until the bike-sharing programs of the 21st century."
    },
    {
      "question": "What connection exists between the counterculture and Silicon Valley technology?",
      "options": {
        "A": "There is no connection; tech emerged from military research alone",
        "B": "Hippies invested their drug profits in early computer companies",

        "D": "The government funded tech to monitor counterculture communications"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog embodied the philosophy of 'access to tools' and individual empowerment. The Homebrew Computer Club, founded by a draft resister, brought countercultural ideals of decentralized, democratized technology to personal computing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the 1973 oil crisis effectively end the counterculture's mass dropout experiment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Communes could no longer afford fuel to heat their buildings",
        "B": "Economic contraction eliminated the affluence that had enabled people to opt out of the system",
        "C": "The government used the crisis as pretext to shut down communes",
        "D": "Rising gas prices made travel to festivals impossible"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Great Refusal was fueled by affluence; when the oil crisis triggered economic recession, the material conditions for mass dropout disappeared. Young people could no longer afford experiments in alternative living and had to seek conventional employment."
