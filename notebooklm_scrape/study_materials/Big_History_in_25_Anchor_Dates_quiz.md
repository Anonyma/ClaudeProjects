**Q1:** C - The Big Bang was characterized by an unimaginable amount of energy, which was crucial for creating the conditions necessary for complexity to emerge.

**Q2:** B - Goldilocks conditions are the specific circumstances that are 'just right' for complexity to develop, such as the right temperature and energy levels.

**Q3:** B - Energy is the first engine because it powers the systems necessary for complexity, from stars to civilizations.

**Q4:** B - The formation of the solar system and Earth marks a critical point where the right conditions were established for life to eventually emerge.

**Q5:** B - Institutions, such as gravity at the cosmic level, help organize and hold together separate entities, allowing complexity to scale.

**Q6:** B - The Great Oxidation Event was significant because the production of oxygen by cyanobacteria led to a mass extinction of many anaerobic organisms.

**Q7:** C - Gravity is an institution that organizes matter, whereas DNA, writing, and spoken language are all forms of information technology that store and share instructions.

**Q8:** C - The Big History framework emphasizes that history is a coherent story where events are interconnected and driven by specific engines.
