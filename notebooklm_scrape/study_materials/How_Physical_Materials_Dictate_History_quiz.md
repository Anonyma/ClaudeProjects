**Q1:** C - The podcast argues that history is actually dictated by physical materials, geology, and resources rather than solely by human actions.

**Q2:** B - Christian Jorgensen Thompson was a Danish curator who created the three-age system to organize artifacts based on their material composition.

**Q3:** B - Thompson used stratigraphy and context to determine the age and significance of artifacts based on their layers and associations.

**Q4:** C - Early humans started with copper to create bronze, which is an alloy made by mixing copper with tin.
