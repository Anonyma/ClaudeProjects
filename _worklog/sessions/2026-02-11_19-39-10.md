## Prompt
"please review the project in the curret folder which is deployed on https://notebooklmstudyhub.netlify.app/ your job will be to enhance it with links and images and other ways to visually represent information besids just a single long column of text. analyze it and come up with a proposal. also, many images are not beign displayed, and the thumbnails are not proper images, and also right now the articles are not grouped by the notebook they originally belonged to (IDK if we have that metadata on supabase, where I believe they are all stored), which would make this much more useful. also the text preview on the main page should be much shorter – for example for Architecture Beyond Postmodernism: Parametric, Computational, and Sustainable Design a lot of text is displayed. each article should have a one-paragraph description describing what topics it covers"

## Plan
- Inspect local project structure and deployed HTML to understand current UI/data flow.
- Audit generated content schemas and image URLs for breakage patterns.
- Draft a proposal for grouping by notebook, shorter previews, and richer visual/linked representations.

## Work Summary
- Reviewed local `study-app/index.html`, generated JSON schema, and deployed HTML.
- Identified missing/broken image URL patterns and data mismatches between local and deployed code.
- Added missing `id` and `slug` fields to Vienna lesson JSON files to fix non-clickable cards.

## Changes
- Added `id` and `slug` fields to Vienna JSON files in `study-app/generated/` so article routing works.

## Commit
- Not created: repo has unrelated existing changes; avoided mixing with prior work.
