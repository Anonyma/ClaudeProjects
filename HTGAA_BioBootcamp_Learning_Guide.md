## 🧬 Day 1: Biology Foundations & SynBio Design

*Focus: Understanding the biological "parts" and the design cycle.*

### 1. Key Concepts
*   **The Central Dogma & Beyond:**
    *   **Gene Regulation:** How cells turn genes on/off (Promoters, Terminators).
    *   **Mutations:** Different types of genetic changes and their impacts.
*   **The SynBio Design Cycle:**
    *   **Design → Build → Test → Learn**.
    *   **Vectors & Chassis:** Choosing the right "vehicle" (plasmid) and "host" (e.g., *E. coli*).
*   **Genome Engineering:**
    *   **CRISPR-Cas9:** Precise editing of genomic DNA.
    *   **Phage Therapeutics:** Using viruses to target specific bacteria.
*   **BioArt:** Using colored proteins (e.g., GFP, RFP) for creative expression.

## 🧪 Day 2: Research Methods & Wet Lab Skills

*Focus: How to design experiments and manipulate DNA in the lab.*

### 1. Key Concepts
*   **Literature & AI Research:**
    *   Using databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) and AI tools for effective literature reviews.
*   **Experimental Design:**
    *   **Controls:** The importance of Positive and Negative controls.
    *   **Reproducibility:** Maintaining a rigorous Lab Notebook.
*   **Molecular Cloning (The "Bread and Butter"):**
    *   **Restriction Enzyme Assembly:** Using molecular scissors and glue (Ligation).
    *   **Gibson Assembly:** A more modern, seamless way to join multiple DNA fragments.
    *   **PCR:** Exponentially amplifying specific DNA sequences.
    *   **Transformation:** "Shocking" DNA into bacteria to make them express your genes.

### 2. Lab Techniques & Visualization
*   **Gel Electrophoresis:** Verifying your DNA fragments by size.
*   **Scientific Figures:** Best practices for creating clear, data-driven visualizations.

## 💻 Day 3: Bioinformatics & Computational Tools

*Focus: Analyzing data and designing biology using code.*

### 1. Key Concepts
*   **Python for Biology:**
    *   Basics of variables, loops, and handling DNA strings.
    *   **Google Colab:** Running Python in the cloud for data analysis.
*   **Benchling (Digital Workbench):**
    *   **In Silico Cloning:** Simulating your cloning experiments before touching a pipette.
    *   **Sequence Editing:** Managing DNA maps and annotations.
*   **AI in Research:**
    *   Leveraging large language models and specialized AI for biological insights.

## 🤖 AI Research Prompts (For Deepening Knowledge)

### **Prompt 1: Gibson vs. Restriction Cloning (Day 2 Priority)**
> "I am preparing for HTGAA Day 2. Can you compare **Gibson Assembly** and **Restriction Enzyme Cloning**? 
> - Explain when I would choose one over the other.
> - Describe the 'scar' left by restriction enzymes and why Gibson is considered 'seamless'.
> - Provide a step-by-step protocol for a standard Gibson Assembly reaction."

### **Prompt 2: Designing a CRISPR Experiment (Day 1 Deep Dive)**
> "Explain the role of the **PAM sequence** and the **guide RNA (gRNA)** in a CRISPR-Cas9 system. 
> If I want to knock out a gene in *E. coli*, what are the three most critical components I need to design in Benchling?"
