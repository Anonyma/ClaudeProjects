# Writing Challenge - Session Notes
**Last updated:** January 25, 2026

## Current State
The themed writing app is in `index-themed.html` with 5 selectable themes:
1. **Fireside** (default) - Dark mode, candlelight, amber glows
2. **Greenhouse** - Nature theme, growing plant indicator
3. **Coffee Shop** - Cafe table, spiral notebook, sticky notes
4. **Journal** - Personal diary, washi tape, mood stickers
5. **Cabin** - Rustic 8-bit prairie cabin with flowers

## Recent Changes
- Fixed dark mode hover issue in Library view (was white text on white bg)
- Added time display to saved writings
- Renamed "texts" to "Library" (Journal theme shows "Pages")
- Added font-display class to headings for theme consistency
- Restored Coffee Shop theme to original design per screenshot
- Redesigned Cabin theme to be more rustic/8-bit with prairie flowers

## Files

- `design-lab/` - Original design variants for reference
- `design-lab/variant-3-coffeeshop.html` - Original coffee shop (reference only, actual design restored in main file)

## What Was Being Discussed
