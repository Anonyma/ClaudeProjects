      "content": "a very quick note on some thoughts on... money? or more like a quick reflection on it. I notice that whenever money is involved in any sort of exchange or expressed desired or something (by anyone, not me), it feels non-virtuous, like almost impure. like it tarnishes the goodness, the purity, and the \"merit\" of the thing it is involved with.\nit's like intentions and dreams and goals are only noble is they are selfless.\nthis is actually my internal view, and I feel like that has probably impacted a lot my relationship with money even in my career.\nbecause I have felt (and feel) like money and other material resources are a scarce resource, and since I don't feel very confident in my ability to obtain any form of capital, it leads to me being very stressed out always.\nIt makes it so that any decisions I need to make that imply having to let go of money feel almost like a life-or-death situation; they trigger some survival insticts. \nThis also applies the other way around, though, where if I have to ask for money, for a price, for a raise, something in my mind cannot stop screaming. It just seems so wrong, asking for money? How can I possibly argue my worth? Plus, it might burden the other side. They might not have enough. What am I going to do with all this money? (I am not even rich) It just feels... icky.\n\nAnd so, when I am shopping, or when I am asked for how much I want to be paid, I just default on whatever comes first, just to get to the other side of the transaction. It's painful. (wait, was that hyperbolic? It's definitely extremely uncomfortable and creates anxiety, so let's call it painful)\nI would much rather live in a society where everything was free. A society run by robots and AI that takes care of all the tasks we need done with the minimum amount of human contribution, where we could pursue our studies, develop ourselves, and create art and try out projects and build community.\nIn a way, that's the vision we hold in EA, and for many it might be the reason why effective altruists are so ready to give their money and work for free.\nBut there is definitely something within me that creates a mental block around any money stuff, and it's causing me a lot of problems.\n\nI thought I had gotten better at negotiating, but any amount that I'm offered just triggers a sense of guilt in me... how can they possibly pay me so much? That must be too much, right?\nAs if my own perspective were so trustworthy. Why do I overweigh my judgement of my own worth over any other signal I get from others? Hm, that's actually very interesting. Is this some sort of impostor syndrome?\nPlus, it has only caused me harm, in terms of material resources but also in terms of time. In terms of time, because by receiving less money from others I have to do more total work in order to be able to sustain myself. And I'm trading in my time for each of these income-generating activities, meaning that I am actually dedicating a non-optimal amount of time to myself and my own goals. I am doing the world a disservice.\n\nI wonder if my desire to not ask for much comes from my religious upbringing, imbued with the value of abnegation, sacrifice, and selflessness. If my sense of self-worth is tied to how virtuous and non-selfish I am with my actions. Selflessness, as I'm defining it right now, is the absence of self(-interest). But then, if I am not interested in myself, if I don't care for myself, what is even the point of living? Who is this \"me\" that I am seeking to \"save\" by acting selfless? Is it just something I've been told, and that I internalized? This doesn't seem healthy.",

      "content": "NEW RENAISSANCE / from the humanities-maxxing perspective\nI truly believe we are about to start an era of New Renaissance (or at least I do believe I am about to).\nRight now, these digital robotic \"agents\" are freeing me up of so much of my pending \"work\", yet they are still keeping me enslaved to my glowing silicon-based portals. They are some very needy workers, like hyperactive tamagotchis that constantly need my reassurance and help. However, these babies have the capacities in them to run unsupervised for many hours, roaming the branches and caves of the internet, in search of gold or any other material I might want them to find or make. Soon, I will overcome my current incompetence and clunkiness when it comes to directing these agents, and they will learn to better organize themselves.\n\nThat transition will mean a lot of \"empty spaces\" within my schedule, which, yes, I am sure I will keep filling with infinitely-spawning new tasks from other projects, but... the autonomous agents will take care of those too. Heh, the only constraint in that world is how quickly I can give them their tasks. Hah, when I was a kid and asked what job AI couldn't replace, the answer that surfaced was \"the job of deciding what tasks to give the AI\" - or something like that. \n\nSo there will be a time (and it will happen soon), when I will reclaim the hours I \"worked\" each day, and I won't need to fill them up with other projects. I will be able to dedicate them to creative and intellectual exploration. Or just to doing the things I wanted to do as a kid.\n\nI can explore the world - not physically necessarily. Although in time I might be able to afford a new kind of travelling, where I am guided by my personal agents into the regions I am most curious about, introducing me to locals and local culture in an organic (albeit agent-facilitated) way. That doesn't sound bad actually.\nI can explore each person I meet - by being attentive to their words and actions, forming hypotheses about their worldview (maybe even with AI assist?) and getting to know them and learn about what makes them tick. My agents can help me prepare for most of my interactions, given they know my connections, past interactions, and have access to my notes about these other humans.\nI can explore nature - going on walks and hikes (maybe there will be affordable robots that will carry me or my stuff so I don't have to be so fit), looking at the sky, at the plants, at the birds, listening to them, connecting to them from within my body.\nI can explore knowledge - philosophy, math, history, biology, culture, economics, law, technology, psychology... whatever I want! I will be able to skim any topic I like and find the information that satisfies my curiosity.\nI can explore sport - and dedicate more time to my health, eating right, sleeping right, doing breathing exercises, practicing all kinds of sports, doing yoga, weightlifting, running, dancing...",

      "content": "On the tension between \"laziness\"/procrastination and ambition.\n\nOne of the most nonsensical combinations of traits to find in a single person is probably the combination of \"laziness\" and ambition. I see this all the time, especially in certain circles like the Effective Altruist ones, where many have a burning calling to save the world and realize their maximum potential (they're maximazers, many of them), yet don't seem to be able to close the gap between what would be needed to work towards maximizing/realizing this potential and what they actually do with their everyday life.\nADHD, executive dysfunction, procrastination, they call it...\nThis \"attitudinal\" contrast feels so incoherent. How can someone so fervently desire to be such a different version of themselves, to achieve so much tangible action and output, yet metaphorically come back home so emptyhanded? Doesn't their zealous desire, the burning urge just catapult them into action? Are they not aware that unless they take the steps today, they will never reach their desired destination? Are they not aware that the \"lazy\"/procrastination life-style is eating away at their soul?\nOh they are. \nYet the suffering continues. \nIt is clear that the will to act, the intellectual and strategic realizations do not alone pull them (me) from the spiral.\nWhat an odd way to live.\n\nThinking about it, this should be a very widespread condition. And it is, I believe. I assume such discordances are behind so many people's issues - not just the ambitious folks. It's more abstract, less obvious when what you want is not something tangible or measurable. Even if it is, it's easy for people to be in denial. But the same mechanism is probably behind their suffering. \n\nInterestingly, there seems to be a common pattern among the highly ambitious and the people who have given up - they both seem to have accepted that nothing they do will change their course. Both seem to have internalized that they are hopeless and helpless. Only one of them is okay with that - and it's usually the one that has given up. For the other, the \"hunger\" is eating them alive.\n\nI don't know if the lesson here is that I should give up ambition, or that I should believe more in my power to change my life. At this point, I have tried A LOT - many, many interventions for my own life. It just seems like the interventions are never quite effective.\n\nWhich leads me to think that maybe the problem is in how I relate to interventions. Am I perhaps too \"desperate\" about them? Each time I am SO expectant, so excited, so hopeful that IT is the ONE that will change my life. And because of that energy, I think I burn out pretty quickly. I cannot sustain the motivation for too long, or I get frustrated, or I just stop keeping up with the habit.\n\nMaybe the solution is to just chill a little bit with it, and implement small changes that don't feel like such a big deal, without putting so much pressure on. Just little additions to the routine that become a new normal, not in a very intentional way but in a very natural one.",

      "content": "Every morning at 8am, I wake up, like clockwork. Well, they wake me up, as they do with all of us every morning.\nAt 8:15am, like clockwork, I am bathed. It reminds me of when I used to bathe little Annika before her day of school. Except, unlike her, I do not resist; I just let the inevitable happen. Gone are the weekends when I needn't abandon the comfort of my pyjamas.\n\nAt 9am, like clockwork, breakfast is served. I wonder if today it will be the green or the yellow paste. 2 days ago, it had nice little bits I could chew on. It must have been accidental, but it brought some spice to my days. \nIt had been a while since I exercised my gums like that. It felt a little bit painful, and I regretted just a little bit later not just swallowing them, but, at this point, pain is one of the few things that makes me feel alive. I still savor that moment in my memory like a wound that keeps getting scratched. (Honestly, that might also be the source of my reminiscing, but at this point, I don't care anymore.)\n\nAt 9:30am, after I've \"enjoyed\" my breakfast, I take my pills. They have a bright yellow color, but they taste more like a dirty brown. I guess the manufacturers couldn't figure out a way to make them taste any better.\nI take four of them, three times a day: after breakfast, after lunch, and after dinner.\n\nToday, after taking my morning pills, I was brought to Edith's funeral. I knew it was coming, but I wasn't told until I was already on my way.\n\"You're going to see Edith!\" They always speak to us like we're five years old. Yeah, there might be some of us who are that, in their minds... but I'm here. I'm present. I still have all of my mental faculties, and am doing well.\n\nAt this point, I wonder if they even know, if they even care. They do seem overworked, the caretakers. But still, a bit of dignity is the least of what we deserve - not being talked to like we're too dumb to understand.\n\nIt was my chance to go out in the open, which was nice. I don't get to do that often, but when I am out, I try to forget that I don't get to go out very often. It helps me be more at ease while I'm there.\n\nEdith didn't have much family. In fact, she might have had none, I remember her saying. I think I was the closest person to her. It breaks me a little bit on the inside, knowing that my days will come, and I will be more alone than her. No one I have known for more than 1 year will be there - well, maybe a few of these caretakers, but none of them is close. None of them knows me for who I am, only for who I was conditioned to be in this house.\n\nI hope I'll be dead by then. I hope there's more than this, for me. It would be a waste, just waiting for time to run out, for my clock to stop ticking.",

(Well, honestly, even when I don't find my flow and I'm stuck somewhere in between, unable to act, or just rotting being.)\n\nPlaying video games, especially this immersive exploration kind, brings me joy that I never imagined it could. And if some humans try to play with me and poke at me, it brings me pain and disgust. \nI wonder if that's healthy. (also, healthy for what?)\nAt least temporarily, it lets me be. It lets me just experience pleasure in its simple form. It \"turns down\" my brain. And from there, I feel I am able to start rebuilding.\n\nSimilarly, watching anime makes me feel warm. It makes me forget that I am an adult in the midst of adulting, and makes me feel the emotions I felt as a kid, when things were much simpler, when time felt infinite, when the future was so distant... I never thought I would be 30.\n\nActually, that's the thing, isn't it.\nI never thought I would be 30. I assumed I wouldn't be. Maybe I didn't want to be. Maybe it seemed so crazy-far that it didn't deserve contemplation.\n\nAnd that's probably a reason why I feel so alien sometimes. I don't feel like life is finite. I don't know if I want to either. And because of that, I am not very aware of what I want to be spending my time on. \n\nIf I have a lot of time, why would I not spend it on video games?\nThis is the same question as: if I have a lot of time, why would I not spend it doing useful work?\nBecause I am spending my time on the things that give me joy in the immediate. \nWhich can be doing useful things. But the \"time is infinite\" illusion makes me feel like it does not matter when I do the useful things. It feels like I have infinite time to do them (later).\n\nOh, that's neat actually. Is this why I procrastinate?",
